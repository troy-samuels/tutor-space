# Repository Law Baseline
# ========================
# Files listed here have legacy Repository Law violations that are grandfathered.
# These violations should be fixed when the file is next modified.
#
# Generated: 2026-01-05 (verified)
# Total legacy files: 46
#
# Note: Modular directories (bookings/, messaging/, tutor-sites/, students/,
# auth/, subscriptions/, progress/, marketplace/) are CLEAN and use repositories.
#
# Note: Some files contain Supabase Storage operations (not database queries)
# which are allowed but the script's pattern matching catches them.
# Storage files: progress/uploads.ts, messaging/uploads.ts, marketplace/delivery.ts,
#                profile.ts, profile-wizard.ts, student-avatar.ts
