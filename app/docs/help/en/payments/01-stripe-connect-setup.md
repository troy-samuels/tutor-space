## Why Stripe Connect?

Stripe Connect enables you to:

- **Accept card payments** - Students pay with credit/debit cards
- **Get direct payouts** - Funds go straight to your bank account
- **Zero platform fees** - TutorLingua charges 0% commission
- **Professional experience** - Secure, branded checkout

## Setting Up Stripe Connect

### Step 1: Start the Connection

1. Go to **Settings > Payments**
2. Click **"Connect with Stripe"**
3. You'll be redirected to Stripe's onboarding

### Step 2: Complete Stripe Onboarding

Stripe will ask for:

**Business Information**
- Business type (individual or company)
- Your legal name
- Business address

**Identity Verification**
- Government ID
- Additional verification may be required

**Bank Account**
- Bank account details for payouts
- Routing and account numbers

> **Note:** This information goes directly to Stripe. TutorLingua never sees your bank details.

### Step 3: Verify Your Account

Stripe may take 1-2 business days to verify your information. You'll receive an email when complete.

### Step 4: Start Accepting Payments

Once verified, the **Stripe Connect** status in your settings will show "Connected". Students can now pay with cards!

## How Payments Work

### When a Student Books

1. Student selects a service and time
2. At checkout, they enter card details
3. Payment is processed by Stripe
4. Booking is confirmed automatically

### Payouts to Your Bank

Stripe sends payouts on a rolling basis:
- **US accounts:** 2 business days
- **International:** Varies by country

You can track payouts in your Stripe Dashboard.

## Stripe Fees

Stripe charges standard processing fees:
- **2.9% + $0.30** per transaction (US)
