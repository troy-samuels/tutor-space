## Your Booking Page

Every TutorLingua tutor gets a unique booking page at:

```
tutorlingua.com/book/yourusername
```

This is the link you share with students for them to book lessons.

## The Student Booking Flow

Here's what students see when they visit your booking page:

### 1. Choose a Service

Students first select the type of lesson they want from your available services. They'll see:
- Service name
- Duration
- Price
- Description

### 2. Select a Date & Time

After choosing a service, students see a calendar with your available time slots:
- Only times you've set as available appear
- Times blocked by your connected calendar are hidden
- All times display in the student's local timezone

### 3. Enter Their Information

Students provide their contact details:
- Name
- Email address
- Phone (optional)
- Timezone
- Notes about what they want to learn

### 4. Choose Payment Method

Depending on your settings, students can:
- **Pay with card** (if Stripe Connect is enabled)
- **Use a session package** (if they've purchased one)
- **Pay later** (if you accept manual payments)

### 5. Confirmation

After booking, students receive:
- An email confirmation with lesson details

## Managing Access

You can control who can book with you:

- Limited availability

Configure this in **Settings > Booking Preferences**.
