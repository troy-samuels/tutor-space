## Your Bookings Dashboard

Access all your bookings from **Dashboard > Bookings**. Here you'll see:

- **Upcoming lessons** - Scheduled sessions
- **Pending requests** - Bookings awaiting your approval
- **Past lessons** - Completed sessions
- **Cancelled** - Cancelled bookings

## Viewing Booking Details

Click on any booking to see:

- Student name and contact info
- Service booked
- Date and time
- Payment status
- Student's notes
- Meeting link

## Confirming Bookings

If you have approval required enabled, new bookings appear as "Pending":

1. Go to **Bookings > Pending**
2. Review the booking details
3. Click **Approve** to confirm or **Decline** to reject

When you approve:
- Student receives confirmation email
- Booking moves to "Upcoming"
- Time is blocked on your calendar

## Creating Bookings Manually

Sometimes you need to book lessons for students directly:

1. Go to **Dashboard > Bookings**
2. Click **"New Booking"**
3. Select an existing student or add a new one
4. Choose service, date, and time
5. Set payment status (paid/unpaid)
6. Save the booking

This is useful for:
- Students who prefer to book via message
- Rescheduling existing lessons
- Booking lessons paid outside the platform

## Rescheduling Bookings

To reschedule a booking:

1. Open the booking you want to change
2. Click **"Reschedule"**
3. Select a new date and time
4. Confirm the change

Both you and the student will receive updated confirmations.

> **Tip:** Communicate with your student before rescheduling to find a time that works for both of you.

## Cancelling Bookings

To cancel a booking:

1. Open the booking
2. Click **"Cancel Booking"**
3. Select a reason (optional)
4. Confirm cancellation

### What happens when you cancel:

- Student receives cancellation notification
- If paid via Stripe, refund options appear
- Session package minutes are restored (if applicable)
- Time slot becomes available again

### Cancellation policies

Consider setting clear expectations with students about:
- How much notice is required
- Refund policies for late cancellations
- Rescheduling vs. cancellation

## Marking Lessons Complete

After completing a lesson:

1. Open the booking
2. Click **"Mark Complete"**
3. Add any notes about the session (optional)

This helps you:
- Track lesson history
- Add notes for future reference
- Trigger any automation (reminders for next booking, etc.)

## Payment Status

Each booking shows its payment status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Paid** | Payment received via Stripe or marked paid manually |
| **Unpaid** | Awaiting payment |
| **Refunded** | Payment was refunded |

### Marking as Paid

For manual payments (Venmo, PayPal, etc.):

1. Open the booking
2. Click **"Mark as Paid"**
3. Optionally add payment notes

## Filtering & Searching

Use filters to find specific bookings:

- **By date range** - This week, this month, custom range
- **By status** - Upcoming, completed, cancelled
- **By student** - Filter by specific student
- **By service** - Filter by lesson type

## Calendar View

Switch to calendar view to see your bookings visually:

- **Month view** - Overview of the month
- **Week view** - Detailed hourly schedule
