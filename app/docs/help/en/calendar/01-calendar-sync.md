## How Calendar Sync Works

### Blocking Busy Times

When your connected calendar has an event:
- That time slot is automatically blocked
- Students **cannot** book during that time
- You don't need to manually update availability

### What Gets Synced

| From Your Calendar | To TutorLingua |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Event times | Blocked as unavailable |
| Event titles | Shown in your calendar view |
| All-day events | Full day blocked |

### What TutorLingua Creates

| TutorLingua Action | To Your Calendar |
|-------------------|------------------|
| New booking | Calendar event created |
| Booking cancelled | Event removed |
| Booking rescheduled | Event updated |

## Viewing Your Calendar

Go to **Dashboard > Calendar** to see:

- **Yellow** - TutorLingua bookings
- **Blue** - Google Calendar events
- **Purple** - Outlook Calendar events
- **Gray** - Manually blocked times

### Calendar Views

Switch between:
- **Month view** - Overview with booking indicators
- **Week view** - Hourly time grid
- **Day view** - Detailed daily schedule

## Blocking Time Manually

Sometimes you need to block time that's not on your external calendar:

1. Go to **Dashboard > Calendar**
2. Click on an empty time slot
3. Add a label (optional)
4. Save the blocked time

Use this for:
- Lunch breaks
- Admin time
- Buffer between lessons

## Disconnecting a Calendar

To disconnect:

1. Go to **Settings > Calendar**
2. Find the connected calendar
3. Click **"Disconnect"**
4. Confirm the disconnection

> **Note:** Disconnecting removes the sync but doesn't delete any existing bookings or events.

## Multiple Calendars

You can connect both Google and Outlook if you use both:
- All busy times from both are blocked
- TutorLingua bookings appear in both
- Great for tutors with work + personal calendars

## Troubleshooting

### Calendar not syncing

Try these steps:
1. Disconnect the calendar
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Reconnect the calendar
4. Allow all requested permissions

### Events not showing

- Sync can take up to 15 minutes
- Check that the calendar is selected in your settings
- Ensure the event isn't marked as "Free" time

### Double-bookings still happening

Verify:
- Calendar is connected (green status in settings)
- Events are marked as "Busy" not "Free"
- Sync completed before student booked

## Privacy & Data

TutorLingua only accesses:
- Event times (to block availability)
- Event titles (to display in your calendar)

We never access:
- Event descriptions
- Attendee lists
- Email content
- Other Google/Microsoft data

## Next Steps

- [Set up your weekly availability](/help/availability-setup)
- Test blocking time manually
- Book a test lesson to see it appear on your calendar
