## How Availability Works

Your availability tells TutorLingua when you're open for bookings. Students can only book during times you've marked as available.

Think of it as your "office hours" - the recurring weekly schedule when you teach.

## Setting Your Availability

### Step 1: Access Availability Settings

Go to **Dashboard > Availability**

### Step 2: Add Time Slots

For each day you want to teach:

1. Click on the day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
2. Click **"Add Time Slot"**
3. Set the **start time** and **end time**
4. Click **Save**

### Example Schedule

| Day | Time Slots |
|-----|------------|
| Monday | 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM |
| Tuesday | 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM |
| Wednesday | Off |
| Thursday | 2:00 PM - 8:00 PM |
| Friday | 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM |
| Saturday | 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM |
| Sunday | Off |

## Multiple Time Slots Per Day

You can add multiple slots to create breaks:

**With break:**
- 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM

Students see 9-12 and 2-6 as available, but not 12-2.

**Without break:**
- 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM

Students see the entire 9-6 window as available.

## Timezones

Your availability is set in **your timezone**. TutorLingua automatically:

- Converts times to each student's local timezone
- Shows students accurate available times
- Handles daylight saving time changes

Make sure your timezone is correct in **Settings > Profile**.

## Availability vs. Calendar Sync

Understanding the difference:

| Availability | Calendar Sync |
|-------------|---------------|
| Your recurring weekly schedule | Real-time busy/free status |
| "I teach Mon-Fri 9-5" | "I have a meeting at 2pm today" |
| Set once, applies every week | Updates dynamically |

**Best practice:** Set availability for your general teaching hours, then connect your calendar to block specific appointments.

## Blocking Specific Times

For one-time unavailability (vacation, appointments), use blocked times instead of changing your availability:

1. Go to **Dashboard > Calendar**
2. Click on the time to block
3. Add a label (optional)
4. Save

This keeps your regular availability intact while blocking specific times.

## Availability Tips

### Start Conservative

Begin with fewer hours than you think you can teach:
- Easier to add hours than remove bookings
- Prevents burnout
- Tests demand first

### Include Buffer Time

Don't make slots back-to-back with other commitments:
- Allow 15 minutes between lessons
- Account for lessons running over
- Give yourself breaks

### Consider Timezones

If you teach students globally:
- Morning slots work for your timezone + eastern students
- Evening slots work for your timezone + western students
- Vary your availability to reach more students

### Peak Times

Consider when students typically book:
- **Mornings:** Business professionals before work
- **Evenings:** Students after school/work
- **Weekends:** Flexible schedules

## Seasonal Changes

Update your availability for:
- Holidays
- School terms vs. breaks
- Personal schedule changes

> **Tip:** Review and update your availability at the start of each month.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can students book any available time?

Students book in increments based on your service durations. A 60-minute lesson requires a 60-minute open window.

### What if I need to take a week off?

Use blocked times to mark specific days as unavailable rather than changing your recurring availability.

### Can I have different availability for different services?

Currently, availability applies to all services. Use service-specific notes to guide students on best times.

### How far in advance can students book?

By default, students can book up to 60 days ahead. This can be adjusted in your booking settings.
