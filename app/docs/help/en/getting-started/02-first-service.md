## What is a Service?

A service in TutorLingua represents a type of lesson you offer. For example:

- 30-minute conversation practice
- 60-minute grammar lesson
- 45-minute exam preparation session

Each service has its own name, description, duration, and price.

1. Go to **Dashboard > Services** in your TutorLingua account
2. Click **"Add Service"**
3. Fill in the service details:

You can create packages in **Dashboard > Session Packages**.

### Clear Naming

| "Lesson" | "Conversational Practice - 60 min" |
| "Session" | "Grammar Deep Dive - 45 min" |
| "Class" | "Business English Coaching" |
