## Creating Your Account

Getting started with TutorLingua takes just a few minutes. Here's how to set up your account:

1. **Visit the signup page** at [tutorlingua.com/signup](/signup)
2. **Enter your email** and create a secure password
3. **Verify your email** by clicking the link we send you

Once verified, you'll be guided through our onboarding process.

## The Onboarding Process

TutorLingua's onboarding wizard helps you set up everything you need in 6 simple steps:

### Step 1: Profile Basics

Fill in your basic information:

- **Full name** - How students will see you
- **Username** - Your unique booking URL (e.g., tutorlingua.com/book/yourname)
- **Timezone** - Ensures bookings display in the correct time
- **Profile photo** - A professional photo helps build trust

### Step 2: Professional Info

Add details about your tutoring experience:

- **Tagline** - A short description (e.g., "Native Spanish tutor with 5 years experience")
- **Bio** - Tell students about your teaching style and background
- **Website** (optional) - Link to your portfolio or social media

### Step 3: Languages & First Service

Set up what you teach:

- **Languages you teach** - Select from our list of supported languages
- **Your first service** - Create your first lesson type with:
  - Service name (e.g., "Conversational Spanish")
  - Duration (30, 45, 60 minutes, etc.)
  - Price per session

### Step 4: Availability

Define when you're available for lessons:

- Set your weekly recurring schedule
- Add different time slots for each day
- All times are automatically converted to your students' timezones

### Step 5: Calendar Sync (Optional)

Connect your existing calendar to prevent double-bookings:

- Google Calendar
- Microsoft Outlook

This step is optional but highly recommended.

### Step 6: Payment Setup

Choose how you want to receive payments:

- **Stripe Connect** - Accept card payments directly (recommended)
- **Manual payments** - Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, or bank transfer

## After Onboarding

Once you complete onboarding, you'll have access to:

- Your **dashboard** with booking overview
- Your **public booking page** to share with students
- **Student management** tools
- **Analytics** to track your business
