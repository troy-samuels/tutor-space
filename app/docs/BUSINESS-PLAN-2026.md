# TutorLingua: $10K MRR in 12 Months
## Bootstrapped Growth Plan for 2026

---

## Executive Summary

**Goal:** Reach $10,000 Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) by December 2026

**Current State:** Pre-launch, product complete, 0 paying customers

**Founder Constraints:**
- Part-time (10-20 hours/week)
- $100-500/month marketing budget
- Bootstrapped (no external funding)

**Target Market:** Independent language tutors on Preply, iTalki, and Verbling who want to capture 100% of revenue from repeat students

**Core Value Proposition:** "Use marketplaces for discovery. Use TutorLingua for repeat bookings. Keep 100% of your revenue."

**Revenue Model:**
- Tutor subscriptions: $29/month or $199/year
- AI Practice (students): $8/month + usage blocks
- Digital product marketplace: 10-15% commission

**Key Milestones:**
| Month | MRR Target | Paying Tutors | Cumulative Revenue |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| 3 | $500 | 17 | $1,500 |
| 6 | $2,000 | 69 | $7,500 |
| 9 | $5,000 | 172 | $21,000 |
| 12 | $10,000 | 345 | $52,500 |

## 1. The Opportunity

### Market Size

The online language tutoring market is experiencing explosive growth:

- **Global EdTech market:** $340B+ and growing at 18.3% CAGR
- **Preply alone:** 100,000+ tutors across 90+ languages
- **iTalki:** 30,000+ tutors in 150+ languages
- **Growth rate:** 100% YoY increase in tutor registrations since 2022

### The Pain Point

Language tutors on marketplaces face a brutal commission structure:

| Platform | Commission | Tutor Keeps (on $50/hr) |
|----------|------------|------------------------|
| Preply | 18-33% | $33.50-$41.00 |
| iTalki | 15% | $42.50 |
| Verbling | ~15% | $42.50 |
| **TutorLingua** | **0%** | **$50.00** |

**The Math That Sells:**
- Tutor earning $2,000/month on Preply (at 33% commission)
- Commission cost: $660/month ($7,920/year)
- TutorLingua cost: $29/month ($348/year)
- **Annual savings: $7,572**

### Positioning: Complementary, Not Competitive

TutorLingua is NOT a replacement for marketplaces. It's an addition.

**The Pitch:**
> "Stay on Preply for new students. But when they come back for lesson 2, 3, 4... why pay 33% commission on students you've already won?"

**Tutor Workflow:**
1. Get discovered on marketplace (Preply, iTalki)
2. Complete first lesson(s) through marketplace
3. Share TutorLingua booking link for repeat sessions
4. Keep 100% of direct booking revenue

This positioning removes the "scary" decision of leaving marketplaces entirely.

## 2. Revenue Model & Unit Economics

### Revenue Streams

**Primary: Tutor Subscriptions**
- Monthly: $29/month
- Annual: $199/year (~$16.58/month effective)
- Target mix: 60% monthly, 40% annual

**Secondary: AI Practice (Students)**
- Base tier: $8/month (100 audio minutes + 300 text turns)
- Add-on blocks: $5/block (+60 audio mins + 200 text turns)
- Attached to tutors (students subscribe via their tutor)

**Tertiary: Digital Products Marketplace**
- Commission: 15% under $500 lifetime sales, 10% above
- Tutors sell PDFs, worksheets, courses

### Unit Economics

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Target:** <$50
- At $29/month, payback in <2 months
- At $199/year, immediate payback

**Lifetime Value (LTV) Assumptions:**
- Average retention: 12 months (conservative)
- Monthly subscriber LTV: $29 × 12 = $348
- Annual subscriber LTV: $199 × 2 renewals = $398
- Blended LTV: ~$370

**LTV:CAC Ratio Target:** 7:1 or better

### Path to $10K MRR

**Scenario A: Tutors Only**
- 345 tutors at $29/month = $10,005 MRR

**Scenario B: Mixed Revenue (More Realistic)**
| Stream | Count | Price | MRR |
|--------|-------|-------|-----|
| Tutor Monthly | 150 | $29 | $4,350 |
| Tutor Annual | 100 | $16.58 | $1,658 |
| AI Practice Students | 300 | $8 | $2,400 |
| Digital Product Sales | - | - | $1,500 |
| **Total** | | | **$9,908** |

**Theme:** "Launch small, learn fast"

**Goals:**
- Launch publicly
- First 20 paying tutors
- Establish content rhythm
- $500 MRR by end of Q1

**Key Activities:**

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1-2 | Soft Launch | 10 beta users, feedback loop, fix critical bugs |

|------|---------|-----------|
| Email tool (Resend/Loops) | $20 | $60 |

| Buffer (contingency) | $60 | $180 |
| **Total** | **$150** | **$450** |

### Q2 (Months 4-6): Traction Engine

**Theme:** "Find what works, double down"

**Goals:**
- 70 paying tutors
- Identify top acquisition channel

2. **User base:** Active users = social proof + testimonials
3. **Feedback:** Power users who will shape the product
4. **Community:** Discord/Slack for LTD users = organic marketing

**Warning:** LTD users are not MRR. Track separately. Goal is to convert LTD buzz into monthly subscribers.

**Email Sequence:**

**Email 1: The Hook**
```
Subject: Quick question about your Preply lessons

Hi [Name],

I noticed you teach [Language] on Preply. Quick question: how much of your revenue comes from repeat students vs. new ones?

I ask because I'm working on something for tutors who want to keep 100% of their repeat student bookings (instead of losing 33% to Preply every time).

Would you be open to a 10-minute chat about what you'd want from a tool like this?

No pitch - just research.

[Your name]
```

**Email 2: The Value (Day 3)**
```
Subject: Re: Quick question about your Preply lessons

Hey [Name],

Following up. Just wanted to share that tutors using TutorLingua are saving an average of $400/month in marketplace commissions.

Here's how it works:
1. Keep finding new students on Preply
2. For repeat lessons, share your TutorLingua booking link
3. Get paid directly - 0% commission

If you'd like to see a quick demo, just reply "demo" and I'll send you a link.

[Your name]
```

**Email 3: Social Proof (Day 7)**
```
Subject: How Maria saved $7,200/year

Hey [Name],

Last email, I promise.

Maria teaches Spanish on Preply. She had 15 repeat students booking weekly. That's $1,800/month in revenue... and $600/month going to Preply.

She moved her repeat students to TutorLingua. Same calendar, same payments, same students. But now she keeps all $1,800.

If you want to do the same, here's your link: [tutorlingua.co/signup]

[Your name]

P.S. First month is on me if you mention this email.
```

**Metrics to Track:**
- Open rate: Target 40%+
- Reply rate: Target 5%+
- Demo booking rate: Target 2%
- Conversion from demo: Target 30%

**Break-Even Point:**
- Fixed costs: ~$200/month (hosting, tools)
- Break-even: ~7 customers
- Expected: Month 2

**Runway Without Revenue:**
- Current budget: $100-500/month
- Max burn: $5,400/year
- Recommendation: Keep day job/consulting until $3K MRR

2. **Weekly:** Traffic, trials, conversions, MRR
3. **Monthly:** Full P&L, churn analysis, channel performance

---

## 7. Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Slow Initial Traction

**Risk:** First 20 customers take longer than expected

**Mitigation:**
- Have 3 channels running in parallel
- Lower barrier: free trial, no credit card
- Personal outreach to warm network first
- Be willing to pivot positioning

### Risk 2: High Churn

**Risk:** Tutors sign up but don't stick

**Mitigation:**
- Onboarding optimization (time to first value <7 days)
- Weekly check-in emails for first month
- Feature requests → faster shipping
- Exit surveys to understand why

### Risk 3: Marketplace Changes

**Risk:** Preply lowers commissions or blocks outside booking

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on multiple marketplaces (diversification)
- Build independent acquisition (SEO, referrals)
- Position as "complement" not "replacement"
- Strong community = organic growth

### Risk 4: Burnout

**Risk:** Part-time effort unsustainable

**Mitigation:**
- Strict time boundaries (10-20 hrs/week max)
- Automate repetitive tasks early
- Hire VA for outreach at $2K MRR
- Consider going full-time at $5K MRR

### Risk 5: Competition

**Risk:** Preply builds similar features or competitor emerges

**Mitigation:**
- Speed: ship fast, iterate faster
- Community: loyal users = defensibility
- Niche: own "language tutors" specifically
- AI features: harder to replicate

## 10. Success Criteria & Decision Points

### Go/No-Go Checkpoints

**Month 3 Checkpoint:**
- Target: 20 customers, $500 MRR
- If below 10 customers: Reassess positioning, try new channel
- If above 25 customers: Accelerate, consider more time investment

**Month 6 Checkpoint:**
- Target: 70 customers, $2,000 MRR
- If below 40 customers: Consider pivot or pause
- If above 100 customers: Consider going full-time

**Month 9 Checkpoint:**
- Target: 170 customers, $5,000 MRR
- If below 100 customers: Aggressive tactics or accept slower growth
- If above 200 customers: Plan for $20K MRR year 2

### When to Quit Day Job

**Conservative:** $5,000 MRR + 6 months expenses saved
**Aggressive:** $3,000 MRR + 3 months expenses saved
**Never:** Keep part-time until $10K MRR (safest)

### When to Raise Prices

- After 100 customers with <5% churn
- After major feature release (AI Practice)
- Grandfather existing customers at old rate
