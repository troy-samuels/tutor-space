## Introduction: Why Your Tech Stack Matters

Running an independent tutoring business requires more than teaching skills. You need systems for:

- Students to find your availability and book
- Collecting payments reliably
- Conducting professional video lessons
- Managing schedules and reminders
- Tracking student progress
- Marketing and growing your business

The right tech stack makes you look professional, saves hours of admin work weekly, and keeps students coming back. The wrong choices cost time, money, and students.

This guide covers every tool category, with recommendations for both budget-conscious tutors and those ready to invest in growth.

## Category 6: Hardware Essentials

### Audio (Most Important!)

Poor audio ruins lessons faster than poor video. Invest here first.

**Budget ($20-50)**:
- USB headset with mic (Logitech H390)
- Clip-on lavalier mic

**Mid-range ($50-150)**:
- Blue Yeti Nano
- Audio-Technica ATR2100x
- Rode NT-USB Mini

**Professional ($150+)**:
- Shure MV7
- Rode Podcaster
- Elgato Wave:3

**Recommendation**: **Rode NT-USB Mini** ($99) offers professional quality at a reasonable price. For budget, any USB headset beats laptop mic.

### Video

Students need to see your face clearly, especially for pronunciation.

**Budget ($30-80)**:
- Logitech C920/C922 (1080p, great quality for price)
- Any external webcam beats laptop built-in

**Mid-range ($80-150)**:
- Logitech Brio (4K)
- Razer Kiyo (built-in light)

**Professional ($200+)**:
- Elgato Facecam
- Sony ZV-1 (camera as webcam)

**Recommendation**: **Logitech C920** (~$60) is the sweet spot. Upgrade when you can.

### Lighting

Good lighting makes cheap cameras look expensive.

**Budget ($20-50)**:
- Ring light (12-18 inch)
- Clip-on video light

**Mid-range ($50-100)**:
- Key light with diffusion
- Two-point lighting setup

**Recommendation**: A **ring light** ($30-50) dramatically improves video quality. Position it behind your camera, facing you.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the minimum I need to start?

Google Meet (free) + a payment method (Stripe/PayPal) + a decent headset. You can start tutoring today for under $50 total investment.

### Should I use an all-in-one platform or build my own stack?

All-in-one (like TutorLingua) is easier to set up and maintain. DIY gives more flexibility but requires more technical comfort. Start with all-in-one, customize later if needed.

### Is Zoom worth paying for?

If you teach lessons longer than 40 minutes or need recording, yes. Otherwise, Google Meet is free and excellent.

### What's the most important hardware investment?

Audio quality. A $50 USB microphone makes more difference than a $200 camera. Students forgive pixelated video but not echo-y audio.

### How do I look professional on video calls?

1. Good lighting (face the window or use a ring light)
2. Clean, uncluttered background
3. Camera at eye level
4. Stable internet (ethernet > wifi)
5. Professional appearance (you don't need a suit, but look intentional)

### What about AI tutoring tools?

AI is evolving rapidly. Current useful AI tools include:
- Grammar checkers (Grammarly)
- Pronunciation feedback (ELSA Speak)
- Flashcard generation (Anki + ChatGPT)

Stay informed but don't over-invest in rapidly changing technology.

## Conclusion: Start Simple, Upgrade Strategically

You don't need a complex tech stack to start. The basics—a way to book, accept payments, and video call—are enough to begin.

**Start with Level 1** and upgrade as you:
- Get more students
- Identify pain points
- Have budget from tutoring income

The goal of your tech stack is to disappear into the background so you can focus on what matters: teaching.
