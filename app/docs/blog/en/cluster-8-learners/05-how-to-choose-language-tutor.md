## Introduction: The Right Tutor Changes Everything

The difference between a mediocre tutor and a great one can mean the difference between:
- Frustration vs. excitement
- Slow progress vs. rapid improvement
- Quitting vs. reaching fluency

A great tutor doesn't just teach you a language—they understand *how you learn*, keep you motivated, and adapt their approach to your needs.

But with thousands of tutors available online, how do you choose? This guide gives you 10 essential questions to ask—and what to look for in the answers.

---

## Before You Start: Know What You Want

Before evaluating tutors, clarify your own goals:

1. **What level are you?** (Complete beginner, intermediate, advanced)
2. **What's your goal?** (Conversation, travel, business, exams, general fluency)
3. **How do you prefer to learn?** (Structured curriculum, conversation-based, grammar-focused)
4. **What's your schedule?** (Mornings, evenings, weekends, flexibility needed)
5. **What's your budget?** ($20-100+/hour depending on tutor experience)

Having clear answers makes it easier to find the right match.

## The 10 Essential Questions

### Question 1: What's Your Teaching Background and Experience?

**Why it matters**: Teaching a language and speaking a language are different skills. You want someone who knows how to *teach*.

**What to look for**:
- Formal teaching qualifications (TEFL, CELTA, degree in education/linguistics)
- Years of teaching experience
- Experience with students at your level
- Teaching certifications in the target language

**Green flags**:
- "I've been teaching for 5 years and have CELTA certification"
- "I specialize in beginners/intermediate/business language"
- "I've helped 200+ students reach conversational level"

**Red flags**:
- "I'm a native speaker, that's my qualification"
- Vague about experience or credentials
- No mention of actual teaching methodology

**Note**: Native speakers without teaching experience can still be good tutors—but they should demonstrate *how* they've learned to teach, not just assume speaking equals teaching.

*Tip: A well-written tutor bio often reveals their experience and approach upfront. Learn [what makes a great tutor bio](/blog/tutor-bio-templates) so you know what to look for.*

### Question 2: How Do You Structure Your Lessons?

**Why it matters**: Effective language learning requires structure, not just conversation. A tutor should have a plan.

**What to look for**:
- Clear lesson framework
- Balance of skills (speaking, listening, reading, writing)
- Progression between lessons
- Homework or practice assignments

**Green flags**:
- "I usually start with review, introduce new material, practice together, then assign homework"
- "I follow a curriculum but adapt based on your needs"
- "I track your progress and adjust difficulty accordingly"

**Red flags**:
- "We'll just see what happens"
- "I don't really have a structure, we just talk"
- No mention of homework or practice between lessons

---

### Question 3: How Do You Handle Different Learning Styles?

**Why it matters**: Everyone learns differently. A good tutor adapts their approach.

**What to look for**:
- Awareness that students differ
- Multiple teaching methods
- Willingness to adjust

**Green flags**:
- "Some students prefer grammar-first, others conversation-first—I adapt"
- "I use videos, readings, conversation, and games depending on what works"
- "Tell me how you've learned best in the past"

**Red flags**:
- "My method works for everyone"
- Rigid, one-size-fits-all approach
- Dismissive of your preferences

---

### Question 4: What Materials Do You Use?

**Why it matters**: Quality materials accelerate learning. You want to know what resources you'll be working with.

**What to look for**:
- Textbooks or curriculum (and whether you need to buy them)
- Supplementary materials (videos, podcasts, apps)

- Whether materials are included in the lesson price

**Green flags**:

- Relies entirely on free, low-quality resources

---

### Question 5: How Will You Assess My Progress?

**Why it matters**: You need to know if you're actually improving, not just showing up.

**What to look for**:
- Regular progress assessments
- Clear milestones or goals
- Feedback mechanisms
- Adjustment based on performance

**Green flags**:
- "I do informal assessments every few weeks"
- "We'll set goals together and track your progress"
- "I'll tell you honestly when you're ready to move to the next level"

**Red flags**:
- "You'll feel when you're improving"
- No concrete way to measure progress
- Never mentions evaluation

---

### Question 6: What's Your Availability and Flexibility?

**Why it matters**: Scheduling conflicts are a common reason tutoring relationships fail. Clarify this upfront.

**What to ask**:
- What days/times do you teach?
- What's your time zone?
- How far in advance do I need to book?
- What's your cancellation policy?
- Can lessons be rescheduled easily?

**Green flags**:
- Clear, published availability
- Reasonable cancellation policy (24-48 hours notice)
- Flexibility for occasional changes
- Multiple time slots available

**Red flags**:
- Very limited availability
- Strict, punitive cancellation policy
- Reluctant to accommodate schedule changes

---

### Question 7: What's Your Pricing and Payment Structure?

**Why it matters**: No surprises with money. Understand exactly what you're paying for.

**What to ask**:
- What's the lesson price? (per hour, per 30/45/60 minutes)
- Do you offer packages?
- What payment methods do you accept?
- Are there any additional fees?
- Do you offer trial lessons at a discount?

**Green flags**:
- Transparent pricing displayed upfront

### Question 8: Can You Tell Me About a Student Success Story?

**Why it matters**: Past results indicate future performance. Specific stories reveal what's actually achievable.

**What to look for**:
- Specific examples, not vague claims
- Students similar to you (level, goals)
- Realistic timelines mentioned
- Genuine enthusiasm when discussing students

**Green flags**:
- "I had a student who went from A1 to B2 in 8 months—she practiced daily and was highly motivated"
- "A business client needed to prepare for a presentation in German—we focused on his specific vocabulary"
- References available upon request

**Red flags**:
- "All my students become fluent"
- No specific examples
- Unrealistic promises ("You'll be fluent in 3 months!")

---

### Question 9: What Do You Expect From Students?

**Why it matters**: Good tutors set expectations. You need to know what commitment is required.

**What to look for**:
- Homework expectations
- Practice between lessons
- Communication preferences
- Minimum lesson frequency recommendations

**Green flags**:
- "I expect 30-60 minutes of practice between lessons"
- "We should meet at least once a week for good progress"
- "Let me know if life gets busy—we can adjust"

**Red flags**:
- No expectations (suggests they don't care about results)
- Unrealistic demands
- Inflexibility about commitment levels

---

### Question 10: Why Do You Teach Languages?

**Why it matters**: Passion matters. A tutor who loves teaching will invest more in your success.

**What to look for**:
- Genuine enthusiasm
- Personal connection to language teaching
- Long-term commitment to teaching

**Green flags**:
- "I love seeing the moment when something clicks for a student"
- "I fell in love with [language] while living abroad and want to share that"
- "Teaching is my full-time career and passion"

**Red flags**:
- "It's easy money" (said or implied)
- No clear reason or passion
- Seems like a temporary gig

## The Trial Lesson: Your Real Evaluation

Questions and profiles only tell you so much. The **trial lesson** is where you actually evaluate:

### What to Observe in a Trial

1. **Did they ask about YOUR goals?** (Good tutors listen before teaching)
2. **Was the lesson structured?** (Even a trial should have some plan)
3. **Did they explain things clearly?** (Can they simplify complex concepts?)
4. **Were they patient?** (How did they handle mistakes?)
5. **Did time fly?** (Engagement is a good sign)
6. **Did you speak a lot?** (You should practice, not just listen)
7. **Did they provide feedback?** (Corrections and encouragement)
8. **Did you learn something?** (Even one lesson should teach you something new)

### After the Trial

Ask yourself:
- Did I enjoy this?
- Could I imagine doing this weekly for months?
- Did the tutor seem invested in my progress?
- Was the communication clear and professional?
- Does the price feel worth it?

Trust your gut. Chemistry matters in learning relationships.

## Red Flags to Watch Out For

### Avoid Tutors Who:

1. **Talk more than you do** in lessons focused on conversation
2. **Never correct you** (overly positive isn't helpful)
3. **Don't prepare** anything for lessons
4. **Are frequently late** or cancel often
5. **Can't explain grammar** or language rules
6. **Get defensive** about teaching methods
7. **Pressure you** to commit before you're ready
8. **Make unrealistic promises** about fluency timelines
9. **Don't remember** your goals or previous lessons
10. **Are hard to reach** between lessons

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does my tutor need to be a native speaker?

Not necessarily. Teaching ability and experience often matter more than native status. Many excellent tutors are highly proficient non-native speakers who understand learner challenges better.

### How many tutors should I try before deciding?

Try 2-3 tutors to compare. More than that and you're procrastinating on actually learning.

### What if I like my tutor but they use a platform with high fees?

Ask if they offer direct booking. Many tutors are happy to work directly with committed students. You'll save money and they'll earn more.

### How often should I take lessons?

Once a week is minimum for steady progress. 2-3 times per week accelerates learning significantly. Less than weekly often means forgetting between sessions.

### Can I switch tutors if it's not working?

Absolutely. It's your learning journey. A professional tutor will understand.
