## Introduction: The Hidden Tax on Your Lessons

You've found a great language tutor. The lessons are going well. You're making progress. But here's something you might not realize:

**You're paying a hidden tax on every lesson.**

When you book through platforms like Preply, iTalki, or Verbling, the platform takes 15-33% of what you pay. That money doesn't go to your tutor—it goes to the platform for "introducing" you.

Here's the thing: after your first few lessons, you don't need an introduction anymore. You already know and trust your tutor. But you keep paying that introduction fee—forever.

This guide explains how direct booking works, why it benefits both you and your tutor, and how to make the switch.

## How Tutoring Platform Fees Work

### What You Pay vs. What Your Tutor Gets

When you book a $50 lesson on a marketplace:

| Platform | Platform Cut | Tutor Receives | What You Pay |
|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Preply (new tutor) | $16.50 (33%) | $33.50 | $50 |
| Preply (experienced) | $9.00 (18%) | $41.00 | $50 |
| iTalki | $7.50 (15%) | $42.50 | $50 |
| Verbling | ~$7.50 (15%) | ~$42.50 | $50 |

Your tutor sets their price at $50 because they need to earn $50. But the platform takes a cut, so they actually need to charge more to make their target income—or accept earning less. For a detailed breakdown of exactly what tutors pay on each platform, see our [complete commission comparison guide](/blog/preply-vs-italki-vs-verbling-commission-comparison-2025).

### Why This Matters to You

**Scenario A**: You pay $50, tutor gets $33.50 (Preply)
**Scenario B**: You pay $45, tutor gets $43.65 (direct, after payment processing)

In Scenario B:
- You save $5 per lesson
- Your tutor earns $10+ more
- The platform gets $0

**Everyone benefits except the middleman.**

## 5 Reasons to Book Your Tutor Directly

### 1. Save Money on Every Lesson

The most obvious benefit: **lower prices**.

When tutors don't have to account for platform fees, they can:
- Charge you less while keeping the same income
- Offer the same price while delivering more value
- Create package deals that weren't possible on-platform

**Real example**: A $50/hour tutor on iTalki (who keeps $42.50) might offer direct lessons at $45/hour—and actually earn $43.65. You save $5, they earn $1.15 more. Multiply that across 50 lessons per year: you save $250.

### 2. Help Your Tutor Earn a Living Wage

Teaching is skilled work. Great tutors spend years developing their craft, preparing personalized lessons, and staying current with language education methods.

When you book directly, you're ensuring more of your money reaches the person actually teaching you. It's a way to **support the educators you value**.

### 3. Get Access to Package Discounts

Most platforms don't support (or discourage) lesson packages. But tutors love packages because they provide stable income.

**Typical direct booking packages**:
- 5 lessons: 5-10% discount
- 10 lessons: 10-15% discount
- 20 lessons: 15-20% discount

A $45/lesson tutor might offer 10 lessons for $400 ($40/lesson)—savings you can't get on most platforms.

### 4. Better Communication & Flexibility

On platforms, you're often limited to:
- Messaging only within the platform
- Platform-controlled scheduling
- Platform policies on cancellations

Direct booking often means:
- Direct email/WhatsApp/text access
- More flexible rescheduling
- Personalized policies
- Faster responses

### 5. Build a Genuine Relationship

When you book directly, you become your tutor's direct client rather than a "platform user." This often leads to:
- More personalized lesson planning
- Investment in your long-term success
- Willingness to go above and beyond
- A teaching relationship, not a transaction

## How to Ask Your Tutor About Direct Booking

### When to Ask

**Good timing**:
- After 4-8 lessons (relationship established)
- When discussing continuing long-term
- At a natural transition (finishing a course level, booking next month)

**Not ideal**:
- During your first lesson
- Through platform messaging (some platforms monitor this)
- If you're not sure you'll continue

### What to Say

**Simple and direct**:
> "Hey [Name], I really enjoy our lessons! Do you offer any way to book directly outside of [Platform]? I'd love to continue working with you long-term."

**If you want to mention savings**:
> "I noticed the platform takes a significant cut. If you have a direct booking option, I'd be happy to switch—it would be better for both of us financially."

**If they seem hesitant**:
> "No pressure at all! I just wanted to ask. Either way, I'm happy to continue our lessons."

### What to Expect

- **Many tutors will be thrilled**—they earn more and keep a loyal student
- **Some may not have direct booking set up**—they might create one for you
- **A few may prefer staying on-platform**—respect their choice
- **None should be offended**—it's a reasonable, professional question

## What Direct Booking Looks Like

### Typical Setup

When a tutor offers direct booking, they usually provide:

1. **A booking page or calendar link** (Calendly, Cal.com, TutorLingua, etc.)
2. **Payment via card** (Stripe) or PayPal
3. **Calendar confirmation** sent to your email
4. **Video link** (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)

The experience is usually *smoother* than marketplace booking.

### What You Might Pay

Tutors typically offer direct booking at:
- **Same price** (they just earn more)
- **5-10% less** (you save, they earn the same or more)
- **Package discounts** (bigger savings for commitment)

### Your Protections

"But what about refunds and guarantees?"

Fair question. Here's the truth:

1. **You already trust this tutor**—you've taken lessons with them
2. **Reputable tutors** offer reasonable policies
3. **You can always walk away**—no long-term contracts
4. **Communication is direct**—easier to resolve issues

If you don't trust a tutor enough to book directly, you probably shouldn't be taking lessons with them at all.

## Common Concerns (And Reality)

### "Is this allowed by the platform?"

Platforms generally can't control what you do outside their system. They may have policies against soliciting within their messaging, but:
- You're the one asking, not the tutor
- The conversation happens outside the platform
- It's your money and your choice

### "What if my tutor can't do direct booking?"

Some tutors aren't set up for it. If they're interested but don't have a system, they might:
- Set something up (it's not hard)
- Recommend a platform they use
- Continue on the marketplace (that's fine too)

### "Will the quality be different?"

The tutor is the same person. The quality of teaching doesn't change based on how you book. If anything, tutors may be *more* invested in direct students.

### "What if something goes wrong?"

You have direct contact with your tutor. Most issues are easily resolved by adults having a conversation. If a tutor is unreasonable, you've learned valuable information—find a new tutor.

## The Bigger Picture: Supporting Independent Educators

Language tutors are often:
- Passionate educators doing skilled work
- Competing in a market with app-based alternatives
- Trying to build sustainable careers
- Providing genuinely valuable service

Platform commissions of 15-33% make it harder for tutors to earn a living wage. When you book directly, you're:

1. **Voting with your wallet** for independent education
2. **Keeping money local** (to your tutor, not a platform)
3. **Building sustainable relationships** with educators
4. **Getting better value** for your learning investment

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much can I really save?

On a $50/hour lesson, you typically save $5-10 per lesson through direct booking. Over 50 lessons per year, that's $250-500 saved.

### Will my tutor think I'm cheap for asking?

No—most tutors appreciate students who understand the business realities. You're showing you value them enough to want a direct relationship.

### What if I want to stay on the platform?

That's completely fine. Some students prefer the platform experience. Your tutor won't mind either way.

### Can I use direct booking for trial lessons?

Usually, direct booking is for students who've already tried and liked a tutor. Discovery/trial lessons often happen on platforms.

### How do I pay for direct lessons?

Usually credit/debit card (via Stripe) or PayPal. Some tutors accept bank transfers for regular students.

## Conclusion: Ask the Question

If you have a tutor you love—someone who's helping you make real progress—consider having the direct booking conversation.

It takes 30 seconds to ask, and the benefits are significant:
- **Save money** on every lesson
- **Support your tutor** earning fair pay
- **Get perks** like packages and flexible scheduling
- **Build a real relationship** beyond platform transactions

The worst they can say is "I prefer staying on the platform"—and that's fine too.
