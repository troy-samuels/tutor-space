## Key Takeaways (TL;DR)

- Tutoring platforms charge **both tutors AND students**—it's not one or the other
- Student fees range from **$0 to $15+ per lesson** depending on platform
- **Preply** takes up to 33% from tutors AND charges students additional fees
- **iTalki** is more transparent but still has currency conversion costs
- **Total platform overhead** can reach 35-50% of what you pay
- **Direct booking** eliminates most fees for both parties

## Introduction: You're Paying More Than You Think

When you book a language tutor online, you see a price—let's say $40/hour. You assume that's what you pay and what the tutor receives, right?

**Wrong.**

Tutoring platforms operate on a double-dipping model: they charge tutors commission AND often charge students additional fees. The result? A significant portion of your payment goes to the platform, not your tutor.

This guide breaks down exactly what major platforms charge students and how these hidden fees inflate your actual learning costs.

## The Two-Sided Fee Model

### How Platforms Make Money

Most tutoring marketplaces profit from both sides of the transaction:

**Tutor side**: Commissions of 15-33% of each lesson
**Student side**: Service fees, platform fees, currency conversion

When you pay $40 for a lesson, the breakdown might look like this:

| Where Your $40 Goes | Amount |
|---------------------|--------|
| To your tutor | $26-34 |
| To the platform (tutor commission) | $6-13 |
| To the platform (student fees) | $0-6 |
| Payment processing | $1-2 |

**Result**: Your tutor might receive just 65-85 cents of every dollar you spend.

## Platform-by-Platform Breakdown

### Preply: The Most Aggressive Fee Structure

**Tutor commission**: 18-33% (depending on hours taught)

**Student-side fees**:
- Service fee: Variable, typically 10-18% added to displayed price
- First lesson fee: Sometimes charged separately
- Currency conversion: Additional markup if your currency differs

**Example calculation**:

You see a tutor listed at $35/hour. You book and actually pay:

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Base tutor rate | $35.00 |
| Service fee (~15%) | $5.25 |
| **You pay** | **$40.25** |
| Platform takes from tutor (33%) | $11.55 |
| **Tutor receives** | **$23.45** |

**Your $40.25 lesson = $23.45 to tutor + $16.80 to platform**

That's **42% going to the platform**.

### iTalki: More Transparent, Still Has Costs

**Tutor commission**: 15% flat

**Student-side fees**:
- No explicit service fee (fees built into pricing)
- Currency conversion: 2-3% if using non-USD currency
- Payment method fees: Some methods have additional costs

**Example calculation**:

You see a tutor at $40/hour:

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Listed price | $40.00 |
| Currency conversion (~2.5%) | $1.00 |
| **You pay** | **$41.00** |
| Platform takes from tutor (15%) | $6.00 |
| **Tutor receives** | **$34.00** |

**Your $41 lesson = $34 to tutor + $7 to platform**

That's **17% going to the platform**—better than Preply, but still significant.

### Verbling: Similar to iTalki

**Tutor commission**: ~15%

**Student-side fees**:
- Generally no explicit service fee
- Currency conversion costs apply
- Payment processing varies

Verbling is more tutor-friendly but still takes its cut from the tutor side.

### Cambly: Fixed Pricing, Less Transparency

**Model**: Students pay Cambly; Cambly pays tutors fixed rates

**Student costs**:
- Subscription-based pricing
- Limited tutor choice
- Rates seem affordable but tutors are paid relatively low

**The catch**: Tutors earn $0.17-$0.20/minute (~$10-12/hour), while students may pay $15-30/hour equivalent. Platform takes massive margin.

## The Currency Conversion Tax

If you're not in the USA, currency conversion is a hidden tax on every lesson.

### How It Works

1. You pay in your local currency (EUR, GBP, AUD, etc.)
2. Platform converts at their rate (not market rate)
3. You pay 2-5% more than mid-market exchange rate
4. Tutors may face another conversion when withdrawing

### Real Cost Example

**Market exchange rate**: 1 USD = 0.85 EUR
**Platform rate**: 1 USD = 0.82 EUR (3.5% markup)

On a $40 lesson:
- At market rate: €34.00
- At platform rate: €35.19
- **Hidden fee**: €1.19 per lesson

Over 50 lessons per year: **€59.50 in hidden currency fees alone**.

## Subscription Traps and Credit Systems

### Platform Credits: Designed to Lock You In

Many platforms use credit systems:

1. You buy credits (often at a slight "discount")
2. Credits expire if unused
3. Credits can't be transferred or refunded
4. You're locked into that platform

**Example**: Buy 100 credits for $90 (10% discount!). But:
- Credits expire in 6 months
- You only use 80 credits
- The 20 unused credits = $18 lost
- Your actual discount: 0%

### Subscription Auto-Renewal

Some platforms offer subscriptions that:
- Auto-renew without clear notification
- Have cancellation windows you might miss
- Charge for the next month before you notice
- Make refunds difficult

## The "Tutor Tax" Passed to You

### How Tutor Commissions Affect Your Price

When platforms take 15-33% from tutors, tutors must raise prices to maintain income.

**Without platform fees**: A tutor might charge $40/hour and earn $40
**With 25% platform fee**: That tutor must charge $54/hour to earn $40

**You pay 35% more for the same tutor** just because a platform is involved.

### The Market Distortion

Platforms create artificial price floors:
- Tutors who'd charge $30/hour must charge $40+ to survive
- Budget-friendly tutors become mid-range
- Mid-range tutors become premium
- Everyone pays more

## Case Study: The True Cost of 50 Lessons

Let's compare what you'd pay for 50 lessons with a tutor who wants to earn $35/hour:

### Scenario A: Preply (High-Fee Platform)

| Component | Per Lesson | 50 Lessons |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Tutor needs to earn | $35.00 | $1,750 |
| Preply commission (25%) | +$11.67 | +$583 |
| Service fee (~15%) | +$7.00 | +$350 |
| **You pay** | **$53.67** | **$2,683** |

### Scenario B: iTalki (Lower-Fee Platform)

| Component | Per Lesson | 50 Lessons |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Tutor needs to earn | $35.00 | $1,750 |
| iTalki commission (15%) | +$6.18 | +$309 |
| Currency conversion (~2%) | +$0.82 | +$41 |
| **You pay** | **$42.00** | **$2,100** |

### Scenario C: Direct Booking

| Component | Per Lesson | 50 Lessons |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Tutor needs to earn | $35.00 | $1,750 |
| Payment processing (~3%) | +$1.08 | +$54 |
| **You pay** | **$36.08** | **$1,804** |

### The Difference

| Platform | 50 Lessons Cost | Premium vs. Direct |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Preply | $2,683 | +$879 (+49%) |
| iTalki | $2,100 | +$296 (+16%) |
| Direct | $1,804 | Baseline |

**Using Preply instead of direct booking costs you $879 extra for the same 50 lessons.**

## How to Avoid Hidden Fees

### 1. Calculate True Costs Before Booking

Before committing, calculate:
- Displayed price + any service fees
- Currency conversion if applicable
- Credit system traps
- Compare to direct booking equivalent

### 2. Use Platforms for Discovery, Then Go Direct

Smart strategy:
1. Find good tutors on marketplaces (they're good at discovery)
2. Take a few lessons to verify quality
3. Ask about direct booking options
4. Transition to direct for ongoing lessons

### 3. Ask Your Tutor Directly

After a few lessons, simply ask:
> "I'd like to continue working with you long-term. Do you offer any way to book directly? It would be better for both of us financially."

Most tutors appreciate this—they earn more and keep committed students.

### 4. Pay in Platform's Base Currency

If you must use a platform:
- Pay in USD if that's their base currency
- Use a card with no foreign transaction fees
- Avoid platform currency conversion when possible

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why don't platforms show the true total cost?

Lower displayed prices get more clicks. Platforms add fees at checkout when you're already committed to booking.

### Is it worth paying platform fees for protection?

For first lessons with unknown tutors, maybe. For ongoing lessons with a trusted tutor? No—you're paying for a service you no longer need.

### Can I get a refund on platform fees?

Usually not. Service fees are non-refundable on most platforms. Credits may have complex refund policies.

### Do all platforms charge both tutors and students?

Most do in some form. Even "commission-only" platforms inflate tutor prices which students ultimately pay.

### Why don't more tutors offer direct booking?

Many do, but quietly—they can't advertise it on the marketplace. You have to ask.

## Conclusion: Know What You're Really Paying

Tutoring platforms provide value—they help you discover tutors and handle initial trust. But that value doesn't justify paying 20-50% more for every lesson indefinitely.

**Your money, your choice:**
- Use platforms for discovery (they're good at it)
- Understand the true costs (not just displayed prices)
- Transition to direct booking with tutors you trust
- Save hundreds or thousands per year

The tutor you love doesn't change based on how you book them. But how much you pay—and how much they earn—absolutely does.
