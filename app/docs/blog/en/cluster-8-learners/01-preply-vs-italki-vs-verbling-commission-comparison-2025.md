## Introduction: Why Commission Rates Matter More Than You Think

If you're teaching 20+ hours per week on tutoring platforms, commission fees are likely your single biggest expense—often costing you **$5,000-$15,000 per year**.

The three major language tutoring marketplaces—Preply, iTalki, and Verbling—all take a cut of every lesson. But their commission structures vary significantly, and understanding these differences can help you make smarter decisions about where to focus your time.

This comprehensive guide breaks down exactly what each platform charges in 2025, how much you actually keep, and strategies for maximizing your tutoring income.

## Preply Commission Structure (2025)

### How Preply's Tiered Commission Works

Preply uses a **sliding scale commission** that decreases as you teach more hours on the platform:

| Hours Taught | Commission Rate | You Keep |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| 0-20 hours | 33% | 67% |
| 20-50 hours | 28% | 72% |
| 50-100 hours | 26% | 74% |
| 100-200 hours | 24% | 76% |
| 200-400 hours | 22% | 78% |
| 400+ hours | 18% | 82% |

### What This Means in Real Numbers

**On a $40/hour lesson:**

| Experience Level | Commission | You Keep Per Lesson |
|------------------|------------|---------------------|
| New tutor (0-20 hrs) | $13.20 | $26.80 |
| Established (100-200 hrs) | $9.60 | $30.40 |
| Top tier (400+ hrs) | $7.20 | $32.80 |

### Preply's Hidden Considerations

1. **First lesson guarantee**: If a student isn't satisfied with their first lesson, Preply refunds them and you may not get paid
2. **Payment delays**: Typically 3-5 business days after lesson completion
3. **No control over pricing**: Preply recommends prices and pressures tutors to match market rates
4. **Platform changes**: Commission rates and policies can change with little notice

### Time to Reach Lowest Commission

To reach Preply's best rate of 18%, you need to teach **400+ hours**. At 20 hours/week, that takes approximately **5 months** of full-time tutoring.

## iTalki Commission Structure (2025)

### iTalki's Flat Rate Model

iTalki keeps things simple with a **flat 15% commission** regardless of how many hours you've taught or how long you've been on the platform.

| Lesson Price | Commission (15%) | You Keep |
|--------------|------------------|----------|
| $20/hour | $3.00 | $17.00 |
| $30/hour | $4.50 | $25.50 |
| $40/hour | $6.00 | $34.00 |
| $50/hour | $7.50 | $42.50 |

### iTalki's Advantages

1. **Predictable earnings**: Same percentage every time, no surprises
2. **No tiered system**: New tutors pay the same as veterans
3. **Tutor flexibility**: More control over your schedule and pricing
4. **Community features**: Language partners and community discussions

### iTalki's Drawbacks

1. **High competition**: Massive tutor pool can make standing out difficult
2. **Lower student commitment**: Easier for students to switch tutors
3. **Limited marketing tools**: Fewer features to help you get discovered
4. **Withdrawal minimums**: Must reach threshold before cashing out

## Verbling Commission Structure (2025)

### Verbling's Commission Model

| $30/hour | ~$4.50 | ~$25.50 |
| $40/hour | ~$6.00 | ~$34.00 |
| $50/hour | ~$7.50 | ~$42.50 |

## The Hidden Costs No One Talks About

### Beyond Commission: Other Platform Expenses

1. **Payment processing fees**: Additional 2-3% on some platforms
2. **Currency conversion**: 1-3% if your currency differs from payment currency
3. **Premium features**: Some platforms charge for visibility boosts
4. **Cancellation policies**: Varies by platform, can impact earnings

### The Opportunity Cost of Platform Dependency

Every hour you spend on a marketplace:
- Builds **their brand**, not yours
- Creates students who are loyal to the **platform**, not you
- Limits your ability to **raise prices** above market rates
- Gives you **no control** if the platform changes policies

---

## The Alternative: Direct Booking Platforms

### What If You Could Keep 100%?

Many successful tutors use marketplaces strategically—for **discovery only**—while building their own direct booking system for repeat students.

**The Math:**

| Booking Method | $50 Lesson | Annual (1,000 lessons) |
|----------------|------------|------------------------|
| Preply (33%) | $33.50 | $33,500 |
| Preply (18%) | $41.00 | $41,000 |
| iTalki (15%) | $42.50 | $42,500 |
| Direct (0%)* | $48.55** | $48,550 |

*Via platforms like TutorLingua
**After ~3% payment processing

**Annual savings with direct booking: $6,050-$15,050**

*Note: Students benefit too—see our article on [why booking your tutor directly saves students money](/blog/direct-booking-saves-money-students).*

### How Direct Booking Works

1. **Use marketplaces** to find new students
2. **Build relationships** during initial lessons
3. **Transition repeat students** to direct booking
4. **Keep 100%** of revenue from loyal students

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which platform has the lowest commission?

iTalki and Verbling both charge approximately 15% commission, making them tied for lowest among major platforms. Preply can go as low as 18% but only after teaching 400+ hours.

### How long does it take to reach Preply's lowest commission rate?

### Can I use multiple tutoring platforms at once?

### Do commission rates ever change?

Yes, platforms can and do change their commission structures. Preply has modified their tiered system multiple times. This is one risk of platform dependency.

### Is there a way to avoid paying commissions entirely?

## Conclusion: Make an Informed Decision

The commission you pay directly impacts your hourly rate and annual income. Here's the bottom line:

| If You... | Best Option |
|-----------|-------------|
| Are brand new | iTalki (15% vs Preply's 33%) |
| Teach part-time | iTalki or Verbling |
| Can commit full-time | Preply (if you'll hit 400+ hrs quickly) |
| Have repeat students | Direct booking platform (0% commission) |

**The smartest approach?** Use marketplaces for what they're good at—**finding new students**—while building your direct booking infrastructure for **repeat business**.

Your repeat students are your most valuable asset. Once you've built a relationship, why keep paying 15-33% for an introduction that already happened?
