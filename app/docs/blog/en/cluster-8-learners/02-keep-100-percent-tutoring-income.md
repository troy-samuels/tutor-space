## Introduction: The Commission Problem

Here's a number that should make you uncomfortable: **$15,600**.

That's how much a full-time tutor charging $40/hour loses annually to a platform taking 25% commission.

For many tutors, platform commissions are their **single largest expense**—bigger than software, marketing, or any other business cost. And unlike other expenses, commissions scale directly with your success. The more you earn, the more you pay.

This guide shows you how to break free from the commission trap—not by abandoning marketplaces entirely, but by using them strategically while building a sustainable direct booking system.

## The True Cost of Platform Dependency

### Commission Math That Will Change Your Thinking

Let's break down what you're actually losing:

**Scenario: Teaching 25 hours/week at $45/hour**

| Platform Commission | Annual Revenue | You Keep | Platform Keeps |
|--------------------|----------------|----------|----------------|
| 33% (Preply new) | $58,500 | $39,195 | $19,305 |
| 25% (Preply mid) | $58,500 | $43,875 | $14,625 |
| 15% (iTalki) | $58,500 | $49,725 | $8,775 |
| 0% (Direct) | $58,500 | $56,745* | $1,755* |

*After ~3% payment processing only

**That $17,550 difference between 33% commission and direct booking could buy:**
- A new laptop every month
- Professional development courses
- Marketing to grow your business
- A vacation every quarter
- Or simply go into your savings

*What about your students? They're paying hidden fees too—sometimes even more than you realize. See our article on [hidden fees that students pay on tutoring platforms](/blog/hidden-fees-tutoring-platforms-students).*

### The "Discovery" Excuse

Platforms justify their commissions by providing "discovery"—connecting you with students who wouldn't find you otherwise.

But here's the truth: **discovery only matters once**.

After that first lesson, the platform provides:
- A video call interface (free alternatives exist)
- Payment processing (costs ~3% anywhere)
- Scheduling tools (free alternatives exist)
- A place for students to rebook (your own site can do this)

For repeat students, you're paying 15-33% commission for services worth about 3%.

## The Smart Strategy: Hybrid Approach

### Why You Shouldn't Quit Marketplaces (Yet)

Complete marketplace abandonment is risky for most tutors. Instead, use what we call the **Discovery-Then-Direct** strategy:

1. **Use marketplaces for what they're good at**: Finding new students
2. **Build relationships** during initial lessons
3. **Transition repeat students** to direct booking
4. **Keep 100%** from students who would rebook anyway

### The Student Journey Transition

```
Week 1-4: Student finds you on [Marketplace]
         ↓
Week 4-8: You build rapport and trust
         ↓
Week 8+:  Student becomes "your" student
         ↓
Transition: Move to direct booking
         ↓
Result:   You keep 100%, student often pays less
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Direct Booking Infrastructure

### What You Need (Minimum Viable Setup)

1. **Booking system**: Where students see availability and book
2. **Payment processing**: Accept credit cards, PayPal, etc.
3. **Video platform**: For conducting lessons (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)
4. **Scheduling**: Calendar integration, reminders

### Option A: All-in-One Solution (Recommended)

Platforms like TutorLingua provide everything in one place:
- Professional booking page
- Payment processing (Stripe integration)
- Automated reminders
- Calendar sync
- Student management
- **Cost**: $0-29/month depending on features

### Option B: DIY Stack

Assemble your own tools:
- **Calendly** (free tier): Booking and scheduling
- **Stripe** or **PayPal**: Payment processing (~3% per transaction)
- **Zoom** (free tier): Video calls (40-minute limit)
- **Google Calendar**: Schedule management

**DIY Pros**: Potentially cheaper, more control
**DIY Cons**: More setup time, no integration, looks less professional

## Step 2: Create Your Professional Presence

### Build Trust Without the Marketplace Badge

Students trust marketplaces because they provide reviews, verification, and refund policies. To succeed with direct booking, you need to replicate that trust.

**Essential elements:**

1. **Professional booking page**
   - Clear photo and bio
   - Credentials and experience
   - Languages and specialties
   - Transparent pricing

2. **Social proof**
   - Testimonials from existing students
   - Teaching certifications displayed
   - Professional headshot
   - Video introduction

3. **Clear policies**
   - Cancellation policy
   - Payment terms
   - What's included in lessons
   - How to reschedule

### Sample Booking Page Structure

```

Hi, I'm [Name]! I've helped 200+ students achieve
fluency in Spanish over 5 years of teaching.

What students say:
"[Testimonial 1]" - Maria, B1 to B2 in 6 months
"[Testimonial 2]" - John, Complete beginner to conversational

My approach:

Book a lesson:
- Trial lesson (30 min): $25
- Regular lesson (60 min): $45
- Package of 10: $400 (save $50)

## Step 3: Transition Existing Students

### The Conversation Framework

After 4-8 lessons with a student, you've built trust. Here's how to have the transition conversation:

**Script 1: The Direct Approach**
> "Hey [Name], I really enjoy our lessons together! I wanted to let you know I also offer direct booking through my own site. It's actually a better deal for both of us—you'd save about $5-10 per lesson, and I keep more. No pressure at all, but if you're interested, I can send you the link!"

**Script 2: The Value-Add Approach**
> "[Name], I've set up a new booking system that has some features the marketplace doesn't—like easier rescheduling and package discounts. Would you be interested in trying it for our next booking?"

**Script 3: The Problem-Solution Approach**
> "I noticed the marketplace charged you a service fee on top of my rate. If you book directly through my site, you avoid that fee. Same lessons, just a better deal for you."

### What Makes Students Switch

Students will move to direct booking if you offer:

1. **Savings**: Even $3-5 per lesson adds up
2. **Convenience**: Easier rescheduling, better communication
3. **Packages**: Discounts for buying multiple lessons
4. **Loyalty**: They genuinely want to support you

### What NOT to Do

- **Don't violate platform terms** by soliciting during lessons
- **Don't pressure** students who prefer staying on-platform
- **Don't disparage** the marketplace—be professional
- **Don't rush**—wait until trust is established

---

## Step 4: Price Strategically

### The Win-Win Pricing Model

When transitioning to direct, you can offer students a discount while still making more money:

**Example: $50/hour marketplace lesson**

| Payment Method | Student Pays | Platform Fee | Processing | You Keep |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Marketplace (20%) | $50 | $10 | $0 | $40 |
| Direct booking | $45 | $0 | ~$1.35 | $43.65 |

**Result**: Student saves $5, you earn $3.65 more. Everyone wins.

### Package Pricing Strategy

Packages encourage commitment and provide income stability:

| Package | Regular Price | Package Price | Your Earnings |
|---------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Single lesson | $45 | $45 | $43.65 |
| 5-lesson pack | $225 | $200 | $194 |
| 10-lesson pack | $450 | $380 | $368.60 |
| 20-lesson pack | $900 | $720 | $698.40 |

**Tip**: Offer a small discount (10-15%) for packages. You get guaranteed income; students get savings.

## Step 5: Scale Your Direct Business

### Building Your Referral Engine

Happy students are your best marketing. Make referrals easy:

1. **Ask directly**: "If you know anyone learning Spanish, I'd love to help them too!"
2. **Referral bonus**: "Get 1 free lesson for every student you refer"
3. **Share materials**: "Feel free to forward this study guide to any friends"

### Reducing Marketplace Dependency Over Time

**Month 1-3**: Set up direct booking, transition first 2-3 students
**Month 4-6**: 20-30% of students on direct booking
**Month 6-12**: 50%+ on direct, reduce marketplace hours
**Year 2+**: Marketplace for discovery only, most students direct

### When to Consider Leaving Marketplaces Entirely

You're ready to go fully independent when:
- 80%+ of income comes from direct students
- You have consistent referrals
- Your waitlist is growing
- Platform discovery isn't providing value

---

## Common Objections (And Responses)

### "I'll lose access to new students"

Not if you use marketplaces strategically. Keep a presence for discovery while building your direct base.

### "Students won't trust direct booking"

They trust *you*—that's why they rebook. A professional booking page and clear policies address any concerns.

### "It's too complicated to set up"

All-in-one platforms like TutorLingua take 15 minutes to set up. The ROI is thousands of dollars per year.

### "I don't have time for the business side"

You're already doing the business side—just on someone else's platform. Redirect that energy to your own business.

### "What if marketplaces ban me?"

Don't violate their terms. Transition students naturally, outside of marketplace messaging. Most platforms can't control what happens off-platform.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it against platform rules to ask students to book directly?

Most platforms prohibit soliciting students within their messaging system or during lessons booked through them. However, they can't control your external marketing or what students do independently. Always check specific platform terms.

### How do I handle taxes with direct booking?

You're responsible for reporting all income regardless of source. Many tutors prefer direct booking because they have better records of their actual income.

### What payment methods should I accept?

Credit/debit cards (via Stripe) are essential. PayPal is popular internationally. Some tutors also accept bank transfers for regular students.

### How long does it take to transition most students?

Most tutors report transitioning 50%+ of repeat students within 3-6 months. The key is building the relationship first.

### Should I charge less for direct booking?

A small discount (5-10%) incentivizes the switch while still increasing your take-home. Even at lower prices, you typically earn more per lesson.

## Conclusion: Take Control of Your Business

The average full-time tutor loses **$10,000+ per year** to platform commissions. That's not a fee—that's a significant portion of your income going to someone else's company.

You don't have to accept that. By using marketplaces strategically for discovery while building a direct booking base, you can:

- **Keep 100%** of revenue from repeat students
- **Build your own brand** instead of someone else's
- **Create stable income** with package pricing
- **Have full control** over your business policies

The tools exist. The strategy works. The only question is: how long will you keep giving away 15-33% of your income?
