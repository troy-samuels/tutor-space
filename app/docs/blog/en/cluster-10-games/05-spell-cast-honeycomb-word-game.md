faqs:
  - question: "How does CEFR-weighted scoring work in Spell Cast?"
    answer: "Each word in Spell Cast is tagged with its CEFR level (A1-C2). A simple A2 word like 'casa' (house) might earn 4 points, whilst a C1 word like 'escasez' (scarcity) earns 15+ points. This teaches you that sophisticated vocabulary exists and rewards you for learning it—creating aspiration to discover advanced words."
  - question: "What is a pangram in Spell Cast and why does it matter?"
    answer: "A pangram is a word that uses all 7 letters in the honeycomb at least once (some letters can repeat). Pangrams earn massive bonus points (typically 20-30 points). Finding them requires deep vocabulary knowledge and pattern recognition—they're the ultimate challenge for each puzzle."
  - question: "Is Spell Cast suitable for beginner language learners?"
    answer: "Spell Cast works for A2+ learners, but it's most rewarding for B1 and above. Beginners can find 4-5 letter words and build confidence, whilst advanced learners hunt for rare 8+ letter words and pangrams. The open-ended nature means everyone finds vocabulary at their level."
  - question: "How is Spell Cast different from the NYT Spelling Bee?"
    answer: "Whilst inspired by Spelling Bee, Spell Cast is designed specifically for language learning: words are CEFR-tagged with difficulty ratings, scoring rewards advanced vocabulary acquisition, and the game tracks which CEFR levels you're strong/weak in—turning each puzzle into a diagnostic tool for your vocabulary breadth."
  - question: "How many words should I aim to find in each Spell Cast puzzle?"
    answer: "There's no fixed target—each puzzle has a different total word count (typically 30-80 valid words). Casual players might find 10-15 words in 5 minutes. Completionists chase 90%+ discovery. The real goal isn't quantity—it's learning 2-3 new advanced words per puzzle."

## Introduction

Most language games reward you for knowing *any* word.

Find "cat"? Great, here's a point.  
Find "feline"? Cool, also one point.

But those words aren't equal. One is basic vocabulary every A1 learner knows. The other is sophisticated B2+ terminology.

**Spell Cast** is different.

It's a honeycomb word-building game where **harder words earn more points**—teaching you that advanced vocabulary isn't just nice to have, it's *more valuable*.

And once you understand that, your entire approach to language learning shifts.

## How Spell Cast Works

### The Basic Mechanic

Each day, you're given **7 letters arranged in a honeycomb**:

```
    S   O
  
  C   A   L

    R   M
```

Your job: **create words of 4+ letters** using these letters. The centre letter (A in this example) must appear in every word.

Valid words:
- CASA (house) — 4 points
- COLAR (to strain) — 6 points  
- CALMAR (to calm) — 8 points
- MASCARA (mascara) — 12 points
- SALMOREJO (cold tomato soup) — wait, that's not possible with these letters, but you get the idea

Letters can be reused. You can make MAMA, SALSA, MARACA—as long as each word contains the centre letter (A) and is 4+ letters long.

### The Honeycomb Layout

The honeycomb isn't just aesthetically pleasing—it's **cognitively optimised**.

Research shows that spatial arrangement affects pattern recognition. The honeycomb clusters letters in a way that your visual cortex can scan efficiently, spotting potential combinations faster than a linear list.

Your eyes naturally move in circular patterns around the centre letter, testing combinations: CA, CO, CR, AM, AR, etc.

It's tactile, visual puzzle-solving—far more engaging than typing random letters into a box.

## CEFR-Weighted Scoring: The Genius Innovation

Here's where Spell Cast becomes a learning tool, not just a game.

### What is CEFR?

The **Common European Framework of Reference for Languages** (CEFR) is the international standard for measuring language proficiency:

- **A1** — Absolute beginner (hello, goodbye, my name is...)
- **A2** — Elementary (can discuss familiar topics, basic sentences)
- **B1** — Intermediate (can handle most travel situations, express opinions)
- **B2** — Upper intermediate (can interact fluently, understand complex texts)
- **C1** — Advanced (can use language flexibly, understand implicit meaning)
- **C2** — Mastery (near-native proficiency, subtle nuance)

Every word in every language has an approximate CEFR level based on how commonly it's taught and used.

### How Spell Cast Uses CEFR Levels

Each valid word in Spell Cast is tagged with its CEFR level. **Your score reflects the sophistication of your vocabulary.**

Example (Spanish):

| Word | Meaning | CEFR Level | Points |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| CASA | house | A1 | 4 |
| CAMA | bed | A1 | 4 |
| CALOR | heat | A2 | 6 |
| CALAR | to soak through | B1 | 8 |
| CLAMOR | clamour | B2 | 10 |
| ESCALAR | to climb/scale | B2 | 12 |
| RECLAMAR | to claim/demand | C1 | 15 |

Same puzzle. Same 7 letters. But **harder words earn 3-4x more points**.

### Why This Changes Everything

In traditional word games, volume beats quality. Find 50 simple words, win.

In Spell Cast, **strategy beats volume**. Find 5 advanced words, win.

This teaches you a fundamental truth about language fluency:

**Sophisticated vocabulary makes you sound fluent, even with grammatical mistakes.**

A B2 learner who says:  
*"The government must reconsider their fiscal policy regarding infrastructure investment"*

...sounds more fluent than a B1 learner who says:  
*"The government should think again about money for roads and bridges"*

Both convey the same idea. But the vocabulary sophistication signals competence.

Spell Cast trains you to *hunt for those advanced words*—because they're literally worth more.

## The Pangram: The Ultimate Challenge

Every Spell Cast puzzle has at least one **pangram**—a word that uses all 7 letters at least once.

Finding it earns **massive bonus points** (typically 20-30 points, sometimes more for rare pangrams).

### Why Pangrams Matter

Pangrams require:
- **Deep vocabulary knowledge** (you can't brute-force guess them)
- **Pattern recognition** (seeing how all letters might combine)
- **Lateral thinking** (not just obvious combinations)

In the earlier example (S, O, C, A, L, R, M), the pangram might be:

**SALMOREJO** — no wait, that needs an E and J. Let's try:

**RASCALOM** — not a word.

**CLAMORES** — needs an E.

This is the beautiful frustration of pangrams. You *know* there's a word hiding in there. Your brain obsesses over finding it.

And when you finally discover it? **Dopamine explosion.**

### Pangrams as Vocabulary Discovery

Here's the secret benefit: **most pangrams are advanced vocabulary**.

If the pangram were an A1 word like "casa", every beginner would find it instantly. The challenge comes from pangrams being B2-C1 level words you might not know yet.

Example pangrams from recent Spanish Spell Cast puzzles:
- **RECLAMADO** (reclaimed) — C1
- **ESCARLATA** (scarlet) — B2
- **TRAMPOLÍN** (trampoline) — B2

Each pangram you discover teaches you a new sophisticated word—and you'll never forget it, because finding it felt like solving a mystery.

## Strategy Guide: How to Maximise Your Score

### Beginner Strategy: Build Confidence First

Start with the **obvious 4-letter words**. Get points on the board.

Then look for 5-letter extensions:
- CASA → CASAS (if S is available)
- CAMA → CAMAR (if R is available)

This builds momentum and helps you see letter patterns.

### Intermediate Strategy: Hunt the Rare Letters

Some letters appear in fewer words (like X, Z, W in many languages). If your honeycomb includes rare letters, **use them strategically**.

Words with rare letters are often higher CEFR levels, meaning more points.

Example (Spanish): If you have a Z in the honeycomb, hunt for:
- PLAZA (square) — B1, 8 points
- AZUL (blue) — A2, but contains Z
- FUERZA (strength) — B2, 12 points

### Advanced Strategy: Reverse-Engineer the Pangram

Once you've found 15-20 words, study the letters you have. Write them out:

**S, O, C, A, L, R, M**

Now think: "What advanced Spanish words do I know that could use most/all of these?"

- Words about food? (SALMOREJO needs E, J)
- Words about actions? (RECLAMAR needs an E)
- Words about objects? (CLAMORES needs an E)

Even wrong guesses teach you letter patterns. And when you finally crack it, you've earned every point.

### Pro Tip: Learn From Your Gaps

After each puzzle, Spell Cast shows you the words you *missed*.

This is where the real learning happens.

Scan the list for high-point words (C1/C2 level) you didn't know. Add them to your personal vocabulary list. Use them with your tutor in your next session.

**One new C1 word per puzzle = 365 advanced words per year.**

That's the difference between sounding intermediate and sounding fluent.

---

## The CEFR Heatmap: Your Vocabulary Diagnostic

After each puzzle, Spell Cast generates a **CEFR heatmap** showing which levels you're strong/weak in:

```
A1: ████████░░ 80% found
A2: ██████░░░░ 60% found
B1: ████░░░░░░ 40% found
B2: ██░░░░░░░░ 20% found
C1: ░░░░░░░░░░  5% found
C2: ░░░░░░░░░░  0% found
```

This tells you exactly where your vocabulary gaps are.

### How to Use Your Heatmap

**If you're strong in A1-A2 but weak in B1+:**  
You have beginner vocabulary mastered. Focus on intermediate/advanced words in your tutor sessions and reading materials.

**If you're strong across all levels except C1-C2:**  
You're nearly fluent. Start reading literature, opinion articles, and academic texts in your target language to absorb sophisticated vocabulary.

**If you're weak in A2:**  
You might be overreaching. Go back to fundamentals—common verbs, everyday nouns, basic adjectives. Master A2 before hunting pangrams.

The heatmap turns each puzzle into a **diagnostic assessment**—showing you exactly what to study next.

## Why Spell Cast Works: The Neuroscience

### 1. Open-Ended Challenge (Flow State)

There's no "You've completed the puzzle!" moment. There are always more words to find.

This creates **endless depth**—beginners feel accomplished finding 10 words, experts chase 50. Everyone hits flow state at their own level.

### 2. Aspiration Through Scoring

When you see a word you missed worth 18 points, your brain thinks: *"What word is worth 18 points?!"*

That curiosity drives **voluntary vocabulary expansion**. You're not memorising words because you should—you're learning them because you want to score higher.

### 3. Pattern Recognition Training

Spell Cast trains your brain to see letter patterns instinctively:

- "-AR" verb endings in Spanish
- "-TION" noun endings in French
- "GE-" prefixes in German

After 30 puzzles, you'll spot these patterns in reading and conversation automatically—improving both comprehension and recall speed.

### 4. Productive vs Receptive Vocabulary

Most learners have large **receptive vocabulary** (words you recognise when reading) but small **productive vocabulary** (words you can use when speaking).

Spell Cast forces productive recall: you can't recognise the word "reclamar" in a list and click it. You have to *generate* it from letters.

This builds the vocabulary you can actually *use* in conversation.

## From Scores to Fluency

Here's the beautiful irony: **chasing high scores makes you fluent by accident**.

You're not studying vocabulary flashcards (boring).  
You're hunting for the elusive 15-point word (exciting).

But the cognitive process is identical—and the game-driven motivation makes you do it daily.

After 90 days of Spell Cast:
- You'll know 200-300 new words
- 50+ of them will be B2-C1 level (the vocabulary that makes you sound fluent)
- Your brain will recognise letter patterns instantly
- Your productive vocabulary will match your receptive vocabulary

Then add weekly tutor sessions:
- Use your new advanced vocabulary in conversation
- Get pronunciation correction
- Receive feedback on natural usage

**Games build the arsenal. Tutors teach you how to deploy it.**
