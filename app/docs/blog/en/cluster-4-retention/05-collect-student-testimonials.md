# Collecting Testimonials: How to Get Reviews from Happy Students

Student testimonials are the most powerful marketing tool in your arsenal. Nothing convinces prospective students like hearing from real people who achieved real results with your help.

Yet most tutors struggle to collect testimonials. They feel awkward asking, don't know the right timing, or end up with generic reviews that don't actually help convert new students.

In this guide, you'll learn exactly when and how to ask for testimonials, what makes a review truly valuable, and how to showcase them to attract more of your ideal students.

## Why Testimonials Matter So Much

Before diving into the how, let's understand why testimonials are non-negotiable for growing your tutoring business.

**Prospective students are skeptical.** Anyone can claim to be a great tutor. But when they read a detailed review from someone just like them who achieved exactly what they want to achieve, skepticism melts into trust.

**The numbers back this up:**
- 93% of people read reviews before making a purchase decision
- Students are 4-5x more likely to book with tutors who have multiple detailed reviews
- Testimonials increase conversion rates by 34% on average
- Video testimonials are even more powerful, increasing trust by up to 80%

**Think of testimonials as working for you 24/7.** While you sleep, your best students are convincing new students to book with you.

## The Perfect Timing to Ask for Testimonials

When you ask matters as much as how you ask. The best times to request testimonials:

### 1. Right After a Major Milestone

When a student achieves something meaningful, they're excited and grateful—the perfect emotional state for giving a testimonial.

**Examples of milestones:**
- Passed a language exam (DELE, DALF, JLPT, etc.)
- Successfully completed a job interview in the target language
- Had their first full conversation with a native speaker
- Completed a significant package (20 lessons, 6 months, etc.)
- Achieved a specific goal they set at the beginning

**Your ask:** "Congratulations on passing your B2 exam! I'm so proud of your progress. Would you be willing to share a few words about your experience? It would really help other students who are considering lessons."

### 2. When Students Compliment You Spontaneously

If a student sends you a message like "Thank you so much, I learned more in two months with you than in two years in school," that's your green light.

**Your ask:** "Thank you so much for saying that! Would you mind if I shared this as a testimonial? Your words could really encourage someone who's on the fence about starting lessons."

Many times, you can literally copy-paste what they already wrote. Just ask permission first.

### 3. When Students Refer Friends or Family

If a student refers someone to you, they're already vouching for you. It's a tiny step to formalize that endorsement.

**Your ask:** "Thanks so much for recommending me to your colleague! Since you were kind enough to refer them, would you mind writing a quick testimonial I could share? It would help other professionals like them find me."

### 4. At Natural Completion Points

When a student completes a package, reaches their goal, or decides to pause lessons (for good reasons like moving abroad or completing their objective), it's an appropriate time to request a testimonial.

**Your ask:** "It's been wonderful working with you over these past six months. If you're open to it, I'd love to get your feedback in the form of a brief testimonial. What did you find most valuable about our lessons?"

### When NOT to Ask

Avoid asking for testimonials:
- In the first few lessons (no real results yet)
- After a student had a frustrating experience
- When a student is leaving due to dissatisfaction
- During a busy or stressful time for the student

Timing your request around positive moments dramatically increases the likelihood of getting a yes.

## How to Ask (Without Feeling Awkward)

Most tutors overthink this. Keep it simple, genuine, and direct.

### The Basic Request Template

```
Hi [Name],

I'm so thrilled to see the progress you've made with [specific achievement]! It's been a joy working with you.

I'm working on building my tutoring practice, and testimonials from students like you make a huge difference in helping new students decide to get started.

Would you be willing to write a brief testimonial about your experience? Just a few sentences about what you found most valuable and what results you've seen would be perfect.

I know you're busy, so I've made it easy—just reply to this message with your thoughts, and I'll take care of the rest!

Thank you so much for considering it.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Specific (mentions their achievement)
- Explains why it matters
- Makes it easy (just reply to the message)
- Appreciates their time
- No pressure

### The "Make It Easy" Template

Some students want to help but feel unsure about what to write. Give them a framework:

```
Hi [Name],

Could I ask a quick favor? I'm looking to gather some testimonials from students, and I'd love to include yours if you're open to it.

If so, could you share just a sentence or two about:
- What your goal was when you started
- What you found most helpful about our lessons
- What results or progress you've seen

No need to make it formal or polished—just your honest thoughts!

Thanks so much,
[Your Name]
```

This removes the "blank page" problem and helps students structure their thoughts.

### The Video Testimonial Request

Video testimonials are gold but require a different approach:

```
Hi [Name],

I'm putting together some video testimonials from students, and I immediately thought of you given your amazing progress with [specific goal].

Would you be open to recording a quick 1-2 minute video sharing:
- Why you decided to start lessons
- What you've found most valuable
- What results you've achieved so far

You can record it on your phone and send it to me—no fancy setup needed! Completely optional, but it would mean a lot and really help other students who are considering getting started.

Let me know if you're interested!

[Your Name]
```

**Pro tip:** Offer to schedule a 5-minute Zoom call where you ask questions and record their answers. This is easier for students than self-recording.

## What Makes a Testimonial Actually Valuable

Not all testimonials are created equal. Generic praise like "Great tutor, highly recommend!" doesn't move the needle.

**What makes a testimonial compelling:**

**1. Specific results**
"I passed my DELE B2 exam on the first try after 6 months of lessons" beats "I improved my Spanish."

**2. Relatable starting point**
"I was a complete beginner who couldn't even order coffee in French" helps prospects see themselves in the reviewer.

**3. Concrete details**
"Maria's structured approach and patient corrections helped me finally understand subjunctive tense" is more convincing than "She's very patient and helpful."

**4. Emotional impact**
"I was nervous to speak, but now I have weekly video calls with my relatives in Mexico and actually enjoy it" shows transformation.

**5. Would-recommend statement**
"I recommend Maria to anyone serious about learning Spanish, especially professionals who need results quickly."

## Guiding Students to Better Testimonials

If you receive a generic testimonial, gently ask for more detail:

**Initial testimonial:** "John is a great tutor!"

**Your follow-up:** "Thank you so much! Would you mind adding just a bit more detail? For example, what specific thing did you find most helpful, or what result did you see? It helps prospective students understand what they might experience."

**Better testimonial:** "John is a great tutor! His focus on practical conversation helped me go from being afraid to speak to confidently navigating my business trip to Tokyo. His structured lesson plans and encouraging approach made all the difference."

Most students are happy to elaborate—they just need direction.

## Where to Showcase Testimonials

Collecting testimonials is only half the battle. You need to display them where potential students will see them.

**Your website or bio page:**
Feature 3-5 of your best testimonials prominently. Include photos if possible (with permission).

**Your booking page:**
Place testimonials right before the "Book Now" button. It's the final nudge students need.

**Social media:**
Share testimonials regularly on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn. Tag the student if appropriate.

**Your profile on directories:**
If you're listed on tutor directories (while transitioning to [direct booking](/blog/convert-students-direct-booking)), keep those profiles updated with reviews.

**Email signature:**
Include a rotating testimonial in your email signature.

**Marketing materials:**
Use testimonials in any ads, flyers, or promotional content.

## Making Testimonial Collection Automatic

The best tutors build testimonial collection into their workflow:

**Automated milestone triggers:**
Use a student management system that tracks milestones (lessons completed, months of study) and automatically prompts you to request a testimonial.

**Exit surveys:**
When a student completes their program or pauses lessons, send an automated survey that includes permission to use their feedback as a testimonial.

**Regular check-ins:**
Every 3-4 months, reach out to long-term students: "I'd love to update your testimonial! How have your language skills improved since you first started?"

[TutorLingua's student management features](/features/students) help you track milestones and stay on top of testimonial opportunities without manual tracking.

## Handling Permissions and Authenticity

Always get explicit permission before publishing a testimonial.

**What to include in your request:**
"May I share this on my website, social media, and marketing materials? I can use your full name and photo, first name only, or keep you anonymous—whatever you're most comfortable with."

**Options for attribution:**
- Full name and photo (most powerful)
- First name and last initial (common)
- First name and profession (e.g., "Sarah, Marketing Manager")
- Anonymous with details (e.g., "Business Professional, USA")

**Legal note:** Keep records of permission, especially for testimonials you use in advertising. A simple email exchange works fine.

## Addressing the "Too Few Testimonials" Problem

What if you're just starting out and don't have testimonials yet?

**Start with these strategies:**

**1. Offer trial packages**
Give the first 5-10 students a discounted rate in exchange for a detailed review after completion.

**2. Ask early students directly**
"I'm building my practice and would really appreciate your feedback. If you're happy with our lessons after [4 weeks/10 sessions], would you consider writing a testimonial?"

**3. Use feedback as testimonials**
If students give you positive feedback verbally or in messages, ask if you can formalize it: "That's wonderful to hear! Would you mind if I used this as a testimonial?"

**4. Transition existing students**
If you're moving from a platform to your own site, ask your best platform students to write testimonials for your new independent business.

**5. Leverage case studies**
If you don't have many testimonials yet, write case studies: "How I helped [First name] go from beginner to conversational in 3 months." Students featured often gladly provide quotes.

## Following Up Without Being Pushy

If a student doesn't respond to your initial request, it's okay to follow up once:

**One week later:**
"Hi [Name], just wanted to follow up on my request for a testimonial. Completely understand if you're busy or not interested—no pressure at all! Either way, it's been great working with you."

If they still don't respond, let it go. Focus on other students who are enthusiastic.

## The Long-Term Testimonial Strategy

Build testimonial collection into your business rhythm:

- Request 1-2 testimonials every month
- Refresh your website/materials quarterly with new testimonials
- Share testimonials regularly on social media
- Thank students publicly (with permission) when they provide reviews

Over time, you'll build a library of powerful testimonials that address different student types, goals, and concerns.

## Testimonials as a Retention Tool

Here's a bonus benefit: asking for testimonials actually improves [student retention](/blog/student-retention-guide-tutors).

**Why?** When students articulate their progress and positive experiences in writing, they reinforce their own commitment. It's a psychological principle called "consistency bias"—we want our actions to align with what we've publicly stated.

Students who write testimonials are 30-40% more likely to continue lessons long-term.

## Ready to Start Collecting Testimonials?

Don't wait until you "have more students" or "feel more established." Start today:

1. Identify 2-3 current students who have achieved meaningful results
2. Send them the testimonial request template above
3. Showcase any testimonials you receive on your website and social media

Remember, the best time to ask is right after a student has a win. Make it part of your [student onboarding process](/blog/student-onboarding-process) to set expectations that you'll eventually ask for their feedback.

Student testimonials are the bridge between your expertise and new students who need to hear from someone like them that you're the right choice.

Start building your testimonial collection today, and watch how much easier it becomes to attract your ideal students.
