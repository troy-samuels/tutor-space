## Introduction

*This is a composite case study based on real tutor experiences. Names and specific details have been changed.*

Three years ago, I was a full-time Spanish tutor on Preply. Good reviews, steady students, comfortable income. I thought I had it figured out.

Then I did the math.

I was paying $12,000 per year in platform fees—more than my rent. For what? An introduction service for students I'd been teaching for years.

Here's exactly how I restructured my business to keep that money, and what I learned along the way.

---

## The Wake-Up Call

It started with a spreadsheet. One rainy Sunday, I decided to actually calculate what Preply was costing me.

### My Numbers (Year 2 on Preply)
- 80 lessons/month average
- $35/hour rate
- 25% commission (I'd hit the 50-hour tier)
- 45 regular students, 10 new per month

### Monthly Breakdown
| Income Source | Gross | Commission | Net |
|--------------|-------|-----------|-----|
| Trial lessons (10) | $350 | $350 (100%) | $0 |
| Regular lessons (70) | $2,450 | $612 | $1,838 |
| **Total** | **$2,800** | **$962** | **$1,838** |

**Annual commission paid: $11,544**

I stared at that number. Eleven thousand dollars. Every year. Going to a company that introduced me to most of these students *two years ago*.

---

## The Realization

My student Maria had been with me since month three. Every Tuesday at 7pm, for two years. That's roughly 100 lessons.

On each of those lessons, I paid $8.75 in commission. For Maria alone, I'd paid Preply $875 for a single introduction.

Was that introduction worth $875? Maybe. Was it worth $8.75 per week, forever? Definitely not.

I looked at my student list:
- 15 students with 50+ lessons each
- 20 students with 20-50 lessons
- 10 students with fewer than 20 lessons

The majority of my income came from long-term students who weren't being "discovered" anymore. They were just using Preply as a booking tool.

---

## The Plan

I didn't want to abandon Preply entirely. New students still found me there, and the trial lesson system worked well for discovery.

My strategy:
1. **Build independent booking infrastructure**
2. **Create a professional online presence**
3. **Let students naturally discover the direct option**
4. **Continue using Preply for new student acquisition**

No aggressive tactics. No ToS violations. Just making myself available and letting students choose.

---

## Phase 1: Building the Infrastructure (2 Weeks)

### The Tech Stack I Chose

I evaluated two options:

**Option A: DIY**
- Calendly ($12/month)
- Stripe (2.9% + fees)
- Mailchimp ($15/month)
- Wix ($16/month)
- Total: ~$43/month + payment fees

**Option B: All-in-One**
- TutorLingua ($29/month)
- Includes booking, payments, reminders, website
- Total: $29/month + payment fees

I chose the all-in-one. Less setup, less maintenance, purpose-built for tutors.

### Setup Time
- Day 1: Created account, set up availability
- Day 2: Connected Stripe, tested payment flow
- Day 3: Customized my booking page
- Day 4: Tested end-to-end with a friend

By day four, I had a fully functional booking system.

---

## Phase 2: Creating My Presence (2 Weeks)

### The Website

My TutorLingua page became my primary website, but I also created:
- A simple About page explaining my teaching approach
- Clear pricing (10% less than Preply)
- Testimonials from willing students
- Links to my social media

### Social Media

I already had an Instagram where I posted Spanish tips. I updated it:
- Added booking link to bio
- Mentioned "direct lessons available"
- Started sharing more teaching content

### SEO

I made sure searching "Elena Spanish Tutor" found my website, not just my Preply profile:
- Used my name in page titles
- Added location and specialty keywords
- Registered a simple domain redirecting to my booking page

---

## Phase 3: The Natural Transition (Months 1-6)

I didn't message any students about switching. I just made myself findable.

### What Happened

**Month 1**: Two students found my website through Google. They asked about direct booking. I said yes, offered 10% discount.

**Month 2**: Maria (my longest student) saw my Instagram post about "direct booking available." She messaged asking about it. Switched immediately.

**Month 3**: A student's friend wanted to start lessons. The student gave them my website link instead of my Preply profile. New student started direct.

**Month 4-6**: Word spread. Referrals went to my website. Long-term students gradually moved over.

### The Shift
| Month | Platform % | Direct % |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Start | 100% | 0% |
| Month 3 | 75% | 25% |
| Month 6 | 50% | 50% |
| Month 12 | 30% | 70% |

---

## The Financial Impact

### Year 3 (After Transition)

| Source | Lessons/Mo | Rate | Net/Mo |
|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| Preply (new students) | 20 | $35 | $525 (after 25%) |
| Direct (repeat) | 50 | $32 | $1,552 (after 3%) |
| Direct (referrals) | 15 | $32 | $466 (after 3%) |
| **Total** | **85** | - | **$2,543** |

### Comparison

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Monthly net | $1,838 | $2,543 | +$705 |
| Annual net | $22,056 | $30,516 | +$8,460 |
| Commission rate | ~35% | ~12% | -23% |

**Annual savings: $8,460** (and growing as more students go direct)

By year four, with 80% direct bookings, I'm saving over $12,000 annually compared to staying 100% on platform.

## What I Learned

### 1. Students Want the Option

I was nervous students would feel pressured. Instead, they were grateful. "Why would I pay more to book through an app?" one said.

### 2. Platform Is Still Valuable—For Discovery

I still get 5-10 new students per month from Preply. That's worth the commission. What's not worth it is paying commission on students who've been with me for years.

### 3. The Transition Is Gradual

This wasn't an overnight switch. It took 12 months to reach 70% direct. That's okay—it happened naturally without any aggressive tactics.

### 4. Referrals Change Everything

My best growth channel became referrals. When existing students recommend me, their friends go to my website. Every referral is a commission-free student from day one.

### 5. I Own My Business Now

If Preply changed their terms tomorrow, raised commission, or shut down—I'd lose 30% of my income, not 100%. I have a student list, a website, a brand. That's ownership.

---

## The Honest Downsides

### More Admin Work

Running your own booking system means handling more yourself. Payment issues, schedule conflicts, technical problems—they're on you.

### Some Students Prefer Platforms

About 15% of my students prefer Preply's interface and payment protection. That's fine. I serve them there.

### Initial Setup Takes Time

Building the infrastructure took about a month of evenings and weekends. Worth it, but not free.

---

## Would I Do It Again?

Absolutely. The math is clear: $12,000/year in savings for maybe 5 hours/month of additional admin.

That's $200/hour for "admin work." I'll take it.

---

## Your Turn

If you're paying thousands in platform commission on students who've been with you for months or years, the math probably works for you too.

Start small:
1. Set up a booking page
2. Make yourself findable
3. Let students discover and choose
4. Watch the commission percentage drop

You don't have to leave platforms. You just have to stop paying rent on relationships you already own.
