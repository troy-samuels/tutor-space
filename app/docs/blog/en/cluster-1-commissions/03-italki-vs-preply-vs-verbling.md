## iTalki: The Community-Focused Platform

### Commission Structure

iTalki charges a flat **15% commission** on all lessons, regardless of how long you've been teaching. This simplicity is refreshing compared to tiered systems.

**Example**: $30/hour lesson
- You receive: $25.50/hour
- iTalki takes: $4.50/hour

### Trial Lessons

Unlike Preply, iTalki doesn't mandate free or discounted trial lessons. You can:
- Offer trial lessons at any price you choose
- Keep 85% of trial lesson fees (15% commission still applies)
- Or skip trials entirely

This gives you much more control over your trial strategy.

### Teacher Types

iTalki distinguishes between:
- **Professional Teachers**: Verified credentials, can charge higher rates
- **Community Tutors**: Lower barrier to entry, typically lower rates

Both pay the same 15% commission.

### Pros
- Lowest consistent commission rate
- Flexible trial lesson policies
- Large, engaged student community
- Good for less common languages

### Cons
- More competition (larger teacher pool)
- Students expect lower prices due to market dynamics
- Less marketing support than Preply
- Interface can feel dated

## Preply: The Marketing Machine

### Commission Structure

Preply uses a tiered commission system based on teaching hours:

| Hours Taught | Commission |
|--------------|-----------|
| 0-19 | 33% |
| 20-49 | 28% |
| 50-199 | 25% |
| 200-399 | 22% |
| 400+ | 18% |

**Example**: $30/hour lesson
- New tutor receives: $20.10/hour (33% commission)
- Veteran tutor receives: $24.60/hour (18% commission)

### Trial Lessons

Preply takes **100% of your first lesson with each new student**. This is essentially a customer acquisition fee—you teach for free in exchange for the student connection.

### The Real Cost Comparison

Let's compare a new tutor on each platform teaching 100 hours:

**iTalki** (15% commission):
- Gross: $3,000
- Commission: $450
- **Net: $2,550**

**Preply** (33% commission, assuming 10 trial lessons):
- Gross: $3,000
- Trial lessons lost: $300 (10 lessons × $30)
- Commission on remaining 90 lessons: $891
- **Net: $1,809**

**Difference: $741 more on iTalki**

Even at Preply's best rate (18%), the trial lesson policy still costs you.

### Pros
- Excellent marketing and student acquisition
- Modern, polished interface
- Strong brand recognition
- Good scheduling and video tools

### Cons
- Highest commission rates
- 100% trial lesson fee
- Takes 400+ hours to reach best rate
- Package discounts come from your cut

## Verbling: The Quality-Focused Middle Ground

### Commission Structure

Verbling charges a flat **15% commission**—matching iTalki and significantly better than Preply for most tutors.

**Example**: $30/hour lesson

- Verbling takes: $4.50/hour

### Trial Lessons

Verbling allows you to set your own trial lesson terms. Many tutors offer 30-minute trials at reduced rates, keeping 85% of whatever they charge.

### Platform Focus

Verbling positions itself as premium, with:
- Built-in video classroom with good quality
- Integrated whiteboard and screen sharing
- Focus on serious language learners
- Smaller but more engaged user base

### Pros

## The Multi-Platform Strategy

Many successful tutors don't choose just one platform. Here's a strategic approach:

### Stage 1: Build Your Base
Use Preply's marketing power to get your first students quickly. Accept the higher fees as a student acquisition cost.

### Stage 2: Diversify
Once you have consistent students, add iTalki or Verbling profiles to capture students with lower commission.

### Stage 3: Go Direct
For long-term repeat students, offer a direct booking option. You'll save 15-33% on every lesson with students who already trust you.

This isn't about "beating" the platforms—it's about using each channel for its strengths:
- **Preply**: Discovery and first contact
- **iTalki/Verbling**: Lower-fee marketplace option
- **Direct booking**: Maximum earnings on repeat students

---

## Beyond Commission: Other Factors

### Student Quality
- **Preply**: Wide range, includes many casual learners
- **iTalki**: More serious students, community-focused
- **Verbling**: Typically committed, quality-focused

### Payment Reliability
All three platforms have reliable payment systems. The main differences:
- **Preply** pays weekly (fastest)
- **iTalki** and **Verbling** pay twice monthly

### Competition Level
- **Preply**: High competition, but high student volume
- **iTalki**: Very high competition (largest teacher pool)
- **Verbling**: Lower competition, but smaller market

---

## The Bottom Line

**On pure commission**, iTalki and Verbling win at 15% flat, compared to Preply's 18-33%.

**On student acquisition**, Preply's marketing machine brings more new students, especially for popular languages.

**On total earnings**, a diversified approach using multiple platforms—plus direct booking for repeat students—maximizes your income.

Don't marry a single platform. Use each one strategically based on your business stage and goals.
