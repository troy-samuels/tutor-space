# Best Alternatives to Preply and iTalki for Language Tutors in 2025

The best alternatives to Preply and iTalki for language tutors in 2025 are: **TutorLingua** (0% commission on direct bookings), **Wyzant** (25% flat commission), **Superprof** (subscription-based), **Cambly** (fixed hourly rates), **Verbling** (15% commission), and **building your own direct booking system**. Each platform offers different trade-offs between student acquisition, commission rates, and tutor autonomy. Here's a detailed comparison to help you choose the right platform—or combination of platforms—for your tutoring business.

## Quick Comparison: Tutoring Platform Alternatives 2025

| Platform | Commission | Avg. Hourly Rate | Student Quality | Payment Speed | Best For |
|----------|------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| TutorLingua | 0% | You set | High (direct) | 2-3 days | Tutors with existing students |
| Preply | 18-33% | $15-50 | Mixed | Weekly | New tutors seeking visibility |
| iTalki | 15% | $10-40 | Good | Bi-weekly | Conversation practice |
| Wyzant | 25% | $30-80 | High | Weekly | US-based academics |
| Superprof | €0-29/mo | You set | Varies | Direct | European markets |
| Cambly | Fixed $0.17/min | ~$10.20/hr | Casual | Weekly | Flexible schedules |
| Verbling | 15% | $20-60 | Good | Weekly | Structured lessons |
| Direct Booking | 0-3% (payment fees) | You set | Highest | 2-3 days | Established tutors |

## Why Tutors Are Looking for Preply and iTalki Alternatives

If you're teaching on Preply or iTalki, you've probably noticed how much of your income disappears before it reaches your bank account. Here's the reality:

**Preply's sliding commission** starts at 33% for your first students and drops to 18% only after you've earned thousands on the platform. That means on a $30/hour lesson, you're losing $9.90 at best—and up to $9.90 at worst.

**iTalki's 15% flat rate** seems better, but you're still giving up $4.50 per $30 lesson. Over 20 lessons per week, that's $360/month or **$4,320/year** going to the platform instead of your pocket.

The question isn't whether these platforms provide value—they do, especially for student acquisition. The question is: are there better alternatives that let you keep more of what you earn?

### 6. Preply (Strategically) — Best for Student Discovery Only

Here's an unconventional take: **Preply can still be valuable—but only as a discovery channel**.

**Strategy:** Use Preply to acquire new students, then transition them to direct booking after establishing a relationship.

**How It Works:**
1. Accept students through Preply
2. Deliver excellent lessons and build trust
3. After 5-10 lessons, introduce your direct booking option
4. Offer a small discount (they save too since Preply charges students extra)
5. Move ongoing students to your own booking system

**Why This Works:** Preply spends millions on marketing to attract language learners. You benefit from their advertising without paying for it—you only pay commission on the lessons it takes to convert students.

**Important:** This is against Preply's terms of service if done explicitly. The ethical approach is to let students discover your website naturally and reach out to you directly for future lessons.

### 7. Build Your Own Direct Booking System — Best Long-Term Strategy

The ultimate alternative is **eliminating the middleman entirely** by building your own student acquisition and booking system.

**Commission:** 0% (only payment processing fees, typically 2.9% + $0.30)

**Components You Need:**
- Professional website or landing page
- Booking/scheduling system
- Payment processing (Stripe, PayPal)
- Video conferencing (Zoom, Google Meet)
- Student management system

**Cost:** $0-100/month depending on tools

**Best For:** Established tutors ready to invest in their brand and marketing.

**Pros:**
- Keep 97%+ of every lesson fee
- Complete control over pricing, policies, branding
- Build a real business asset
- No platform dependency

**Cons:**
- Requires marketing effort (social media, SEO, referrals)
- More administrative work
- Takes time to build student pipeline

**The TutorLingua Advantage:** TutorLingua combines the benefits of direct booking with done-for-you infrastructure. You get a professional booking page, payment processing, and student CRM without building everything from scratch.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use multiple tutoring platforms at once?**
A: Yes, most tutors use 2-3 platforms simultaneously. There's no exclusivity requirement on platforms like iTalki, Preply, or Superprof. The key is managing your calendar to avoid double-bookings.

**Q: Is it against the rules to move students off Preply?**
A: Preply's terms prohibit actively soliciting students to book outside the platform. However, if a student independently finds your website and contacts you directly, that's their choice. Many tutors maintain a professional website that students discover naturally.

**Q: What's the fastest way to get students without marketplaces?**
A: Instagram and TikTok content marketing is currently the fastest organic method. Tutors who post educational content consistently (3-5x/week) typically see student inquiries within 4-8 weeks.

**Q: How much should I charge on my own platform vs. marketplaces?**
A: A common strategy is matching your marketplace rate for direct bookings. Students save money (no platform fee on their end), and you keep more. Some tutors offer a small discount (5-10%) to incentivize direct booking.

**Q: Do I need a business license to take direct payments?**
A: Requirements vary by country. In most cases, you can operate as a sole proprietor/freelancer without special licensing. Consult a local accountant for tax obligations in your jurisdiction.

## The Bottom Line

Preply and iTalki served an important purpose—they helped create the online language tutoring industry. But in 2025, you have better options.
