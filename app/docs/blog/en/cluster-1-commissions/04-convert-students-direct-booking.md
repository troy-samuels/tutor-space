## Introduction

You've been teaching Maria on Preply for six months. She books every week, loves your lessons, and has referred two friends. She's not going anywhere.

Yet every single lesson, you're paying 25% commission for a "service" that stopped providing value months ago. Maria found you through Preply, but now she's *your* student—and you're essentially paying rent on a relationship you've already built.

The question isn't *whether* to offer direct booking for established students. It's *how* to do it ethically and effectively.

---

## The Ethics of Direct Booking

Let's address this directly: taking students off-platform in violation of terms of service is wrong. It damages the ecosystem and can get you banned.

But here's the nuanced reality:

### What's NOT Okay
- Soliciting students to book outside the platform while using the platform
- Sharing contact information through platform messaging
- Pressuring students to leave the platform
- Badmouthing the platform to students

### What IS Okay
- Having your own professional presence (website, social media)
- Letting students find you through independent searches
- Allowing students to make their own informed choices
- Serving students wherever they choose to book

The key distinction: **you're not taking students—you're making yourself available, and students choose where to book.**

---

## Why Students WANT Direct Booking

This isn't just about your earnings. Students genuinely benefit:

### 1. Lower Prices
When you save 25% on commission, you can pass savings to students. A $30 Preply lesson becomes a $25 direct lesson—same tutor, same quality, lower price.

### 2. More Flexibility
Platform rules restrict scheduling, cancellation policies, and lesson formats. Direct booking lets you customize the experience.

### 3. Direct Relationship
Some students prefer communicating directly via email or WhatsApp rather than through platform messaging.

### 4. Simplified Booking
Once students know your availability, they may prefer booking directly rather than navigating a platform interface.

## The Infrastructure You Need First

Before you can accept direct bookings, you need the same capabilities platforms provide:

### Essential Components

**1. Online Scheduling**
Students should see your availability and book instantly—no back-and-forth emails.

**2. Payment Processing**
Accept cards, PayPal, or local payment methods. Chasing bank transfers is unsustainable.

**3. Automated Communications**
Booking confirmations, reminders, and video links should send automatically.

**4. Professional Presence**
A simple website or landing page establishes credibility outside the platform.

You can build this with separate tools (Calendly + Stripe + Mailchimp) or use an all-in-one solution like TutorLingua that combines everything.

---

## The Passive Discovery Method

The most ethical approach to direct booking is **passive discovery**—making yourself findable without actively soliciting.

### Step 1: Create Your Professional Presence

Build a simple website or landing page with:
- Your bio and teaching philosophy
- Services and pricing (including direct booking discount)
- Clear booking link
- Professional photos
- Testimonials (with permission)

### Step 2: Optimize for Your Name

When students Google your name, your website should appear. Basic SEO:
- Use your full name in page titles
- Include "language tutor" in your meta description
- Add your teaching languages and specialties
- Register with Google Business if relevant

### Step 3: Establish Social Media

Create professional profiles on platforms your students use:
- Instagram (great for language tutors)
- LinkedIn (for business English students)
- Facebook page

Include your booking link in all bios.

### Step 4: Let Students Find You

Students who want to find you outside the platform will search. When they do, they'll discover your direct booking option and can make their own choice.

---

## The Natural Transition Approach

Some students will naturally transition without any prompting:

### The Name Search
Students who've been with you for months often Google your name out of curiosity. When they find your website with lower direct rates, they may reach out.

### The Social Connection
If students follow you on Instagram or LinkedIn, they see your booking link in your bio. The option is there when they're ready.

### The Referral Request
When students want to refer friends, they may ask for a link to share. Your direct booking page is perfect for referrals—and the new student starts direct.

### Word of Mouth
Happy students mention you to friends. Those friends search your name and find your website—never touching the original platform.

---

## Pricing Your Direct Lessons

The goal is a win-win: students save money, you earn more.

### The Win-Win Formula

```
Platform Price: $35/hour
Platform Commission: 25%
Your Take: $26.25/hour

Direct Price: $30/hour
Your Take: ~$29/hour (after ~3% payment processing)

Student Saves: $5/hour
You Earn: $2.75/hour more
```

### Pricing Strategies

**Option A: Simple Discount**
Direct price = Platform price minus 10-15%

**Option B: Value Add**
Same price as platform, but include extras (lesson materials, homework review, WhatsApp access)

**Option C: Package Incentive**
Single lessons at platform rate, packages (10+ lessons) discounted for direct booking

## Handling the Transition Conversation

If a student reaches out asking about direct booking (they found your website, a friend referred them, etc.), here's how to handle it professionally:

### Do Say:
- "Yes, I do accept direct bookings through my website"
- "The pricing is [X], which is a bit lower than the platform"
- "You're welcome to book wherever is most convenient for you"
- "I'll provide the same quality regardless of where you book"

### Don't Say:
- "You should leave Preply because they take too much"
- "I'll give you a bigger discount if you switch"
- "The platform is ripping us both off"
- Anything negative about the platform

Keep it professional and let students make their own informed decision.

## Managing the Mix

Most tutors end up with a mix of platform and direct students. Here's how to manage it:

### Equal Service
Provide identical lesson quality regardless of booking source. Your reputation depends on consistency.

### Separate Tracking
Keep clear records of which students book through which channels for accounting purposes.

### Respect Platform Rules
Continue following platform terms for platform students. Don't use platform messaging to promote direct booking.

### Gradual Transition
Over time, new students increasingly come direct (via referrals, social media, SEO). Your platform percentage naturally decreases.

## The Numbers: Long-Term Impact

Let's model a tutor after 2 years:

### Year 1 (All Platform)
- 50 students, all via Preply
- Average 25% commission
- 1,000 lessons × $30 = $30,000 gross
- Commission: $7,500
- **Net: $22,500**

### Year 2 (Mixed Strategy)
- 30 platform students (new + those who prefer platform)
- 35 direct students (transitioned + referrals)
- Platform lessons: 400 × $30 = $12,000 gross → $9,000 net
- Direct lessons: 700 × $28 = $19,600 gross → $19,000 net (after processing)
- **Total Net: $28,000**

**Improvement: $5,500/year** (24% increase)

## What About Platform Loyalty?

Some tutors feel guilty about direct booking. Consider this perspective:

Platforms provided real value: they connected you with students you couldn't have reached otherwise. You paid for that service through commission on early lessons.

But the relationship with a long-term student is something *you* built through quality teaching, consistency, and care. The platform facilitated the introduction—they didn't create the relationship.

Paying commission indefinitely for a service that was delivered months or years ago isn't loyalty—it's inefficiency.

---

## Getting Started

**Week 1**: Set up your direct booking infrastructure (scheduling, payments, basic landing page)

**Week 2**: Create or optimize social media profiles with booking links

**Week 3**: Ensure your name is searchable and your website appears in results

**Week 4+**: Continue great teaching. Let students discover and choose their preferred booking method.

The transition happens naturally over time. No pressure, no solicitation—just professional availability.
