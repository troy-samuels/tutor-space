## Introduction

If you're teaching on Preply or considering joining, understanding the commission structure is essential to planning your tutoring income. Preply's fees are more complex than a simple percentage—they vary based on your experience level and include some charges that catch new tutors by surprise.

This guide breaks down exactly what Preply charges tutors in 2025, with real examples and calculations to help you understand your actual take-home pay.

## The Preply Commission Structure

### Trial Lesson Commission: 100%

Here's the part that surprises most new tutors: **Preply takes 100% of your first lesson with each new student.**

That's right—if you charge $30 for a trial lesson, you receive $0. Preply keeps the entire amount as their fee for connecting you with the student.

The logic from Preply's perspective: They spent money on advertising to acquire that student. The trial lesson commission covers their customer acquisition cost.

From your perspective: You're essentially teaching a free lesson in exchange for the *opportunity* to gain a long-term student.

### Ongoing Commission Tiers

After the trial lesson, Preply's commission depends on how many hours you've taught on the platform:

| Teaching Hours | Commission Rate | Your Take (on $30/hr) |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 0-19 hours | 33% | $20.10 |
| 20-49 hours | 28% | $21.60 |
| 50-199 hours | 25% | $22.50 |
| 200-399 hours | 22% | $23.40 |
| 400+ hours | 18% | $24.60 |

### How Long to Reach Each Tier

Let's be realistic about the timeline:

- **20 hours** (to reach 28%): ~3-4 weeks at 5-7 hours/week
- **50 hours** (to reach 25%): ~2 months at 6 hours/week
- **200 hours** (to reach 22%): ~8 months at 6 hours/week
- **400 hours** (to reach 18%): ~16 months at 6 hours/week

Most part-time tutors take **1-2 years** to reach the lowest commission tier.

## Real-World Earnings Calculations

### New Tutor Scenario (33% Commission)

**Monthly teaching**: 40 lessons at $25/hour

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross bookings | $1,000 |
| Trial lessons (assume 4) | -$100 (you keep $0) |
| Regular lessons (36 × $25) | $900 gross |
| Commission (33% of $900) | -$297 |
| **Net earnings** | **$603** |
| **Effective hourly rate** | **$15.08** |

Your advertised rate is $25/hour, but you're actually earning $15.08/hour.

### Experienced Tutor Scenario (18% Commission)

**Monthly teaching**: 40 lessons at $35/hour

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross bookings | $1,400 |
| Trial lessons (assume 2) | -$70 (you keep $0) |
| Regular lessons (38 × $35) | $1,330 gross |
| Commission (18% of $1,330) | -$239.40 |
| **Net earnings** | **$1,090.60** |
| **Effective hourly rate** | **$27.27** |

Even at the best tier, a $35/hour tutor takes home $27.27/hour.

## Hidden Costs Beyond Commission

### Payment Processing Time

Preply pays tutors via Payoneer, PayPal, or Skrill. Each has its own fees:

- **Payoneer**: 2% withdrawal fee + potential currency conversion
- **PayPal**: 2-4% depending on location
- **Skrill**: 1-2% + potential conversion fees

### The "Package Discount" Impact

Students can buy lesson packages on Preply with built-in discounts (typically 5-10%). These discounts come from *your* earnings, not Preply's commission.

Example: Student buys a 10-lesson package with 5% discount
- Normal rate: $30/hour × 10 = $300
- With discount: $285 (student pays)
- Preply's 25% commission: $71.25
- **Your earnings: $213.75** ($21.38/hour instead of $22.50)

### Cancellation Policies

If a student cancels with less than 4 hours notice, you receive 100% payment. However, if they cancel within the policy window, you get nothing—and you've already blocked that time slot.

## Comparing Preply to Other Platforms

| Platform | Commission | Trial Policy | Best For |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Preply | 18-33% | 100% to platform | High volume, many languages |
| iTalki | 15% flat | No free trials required | Lower fees, flexibility |
| Verbling | 15% flat | Trial varies | Video quality focus |
| Cambly | Fixed rate (~$10.20/hr) | N/A | Simple, no marketing needed |

Preply's commission is the highest among major platforms, but they also invest heavily in student acquisition. Whether that trade-off works for you depends on your ability to attract students elsewhere.

## Strategies to Maximize Preply Earnings

### 1. Price Higher to Compensate

If you want to earn $25/hour net as a new tutor (33% commission):
```
Target hourly = $25 ÷ (1 - 0.33) = $37.31
```
Set your rate at $38/hour to actually earn your target.

### 2. Focus on Student Retention

The trial lesson is effectively free marketing. Your goal: convert trial students into long-term regulars.

- Prepare extra well for trials
- End with a clear plan for future lessons
- Follow up promptly with lesson notes

### 3. Teach More Hours Faster

The commission drops significantly at each tier. If you can push to 50+ hours quickly, you'll save 8% on every future lesson.

Consider temporarily lowering rates to book more lessons and climb tiers faster—then raise rates once you reach 25% or lower commission.

### 4. Consider Your Long-Term Strategy

Preply is excellent for building a student base. But once you have consistent repeat students, every lesson costs you 18-33% forever.

Many tutors use Preply strategically:
- Gain new students through Preply
- Build relationships over time
- Make direct booking available for students who prefer it

## Is Preply Worth It?

### Preply Makes Sense If You:
- Are just starting and need students quickly
- Don't want to do your own marketing
- Teach languages with high Preply demand
- Value the platform's infrastructure (scheduling, payments, video)

### Consider Alternatives If You:
- Already have a student base
- Are comfortable with basic marketing
- Want to keep more of your earnings long-term
- Teach languages with lower Preply demand

---

## The Bottom Line

Preply's commission structure means:

- **New tutors** lose 33% of regular lessons + 100% of trials
- **Experienced tutors** (400+ hours) still lose 18% + trials
- **Real hourly rates** are significantly lower than advertised rates
- **Package discounts** further reduce your earnings

For student acquisition, these costs may be worthwhile. For long-term repeat students, you're paying a premium for a service you no longer need.

Understanding these numbers helps you make informed decisions about pricing, platform mix, and when to develop alternative booking channels.
