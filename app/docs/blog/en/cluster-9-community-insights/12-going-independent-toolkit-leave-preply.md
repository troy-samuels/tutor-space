quickAnswer: "To go independent from Preply, you need four things: a professional booking page, payment processing (Stripe or PayPal), automated lesson reminders, and a way to attract students independently. All-in-one platforms like TutorLingua provide these in one solution, or you can build the stack yourself."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Going independent doesn't mean quitting platforms overnight — it means building alternatives gradually"
  - "You need: booking system, payment processing, video conferencing, and a way to find students"
  - "Moving even 50% of your students off-platform can save £3,000-8,000 per year"
  - "Most students are happy to switch to direct booking — they often save money too"
  - "The hardest part isn't the tools — it's having the conversation with your first student"
faqs:
  - question: "How do I transition from Preply to independent tutoring?"
    answer: "Start gradually: set up a professional booking page, then begin offering direct booking to your longest-standing Preply students. Most students are receptive because they often save money too. Don't close your Preply profile entirely — keep it as one acquisition channel while building others."
  - question: "What tools do I need to tutor independently?"
    answer: "At minimum: a booking system for scheduling (Calendly, TutorLingua, or similar), payment processing (Stripe, PayPal), video conferencing (Zoom, Google Meet), and automated reminders. An all-in-one solution like TutorLingua combines booking, payments, reminders, and student management in one platform."
  - question: "How do independent tutors find students without a marketplace?"
    answer: "The main channels are: referrals from existing students, social media presence (Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn), Google My Business listing, community Facebook groups, content marketing (blog, YouTube), and local networking. Most successful independent tutors report that 60%+ of new students come through referrals."
  - question: "Is it allowed to take students off Preply for direct booking?"
    answer: "Preply's terms prohibit actively soliciting platform students for off-platform bookings. However, having your own booking system for students who find you independently through Google, social media, or referrals is entirely legitimate. Many tutors maintain both channels."
  - question: "How much can I save by going independent from Preply?"
    answer: "A tutor teaching 80 lessons/month at £30/hour on Preply (at 25% commission) pays approximately £600/month in platform fees — over £7,000 per year. Moving to direct booking eliminates this entirely. Even with costs for payment processing (2-3%) and tools (£10-30/month), the savings are dramatic."

## The Conversation Nobody Has on Platform

There's an open secret in every Preply tutor thread on Reddit: most experienced tutors know they should be teaching independently. They know the maths. They see the commission on every lesson. They've mentally calculated what that percentage adds up to over a year.

But knowing you should go independent and actually doing it are very different things. The gap between them is filled with practical questions: How do I handle payments? Where do I find students? What if I lose everything I've built?

This guide answers all of them.

## First: What "Going Independent" Actually Means

Let's be clear about what we're not suggesting. Going independent doesn't mean:

- ❌ Closing your Preply profile tomorrow
- ❌ Losing all your current students
- ❌ Starting from zero
- ❌ Building a complicated website

It does mean:

- ✅ Setting up infrastructure so you *can* take bookings directly
- ✅ Gradually shifting repeat students to direct booking
- ✅ Keeping platforms as one of several student acquisition channels
- ✅ Keeping 100% of your lesson fees instead of 67-82%

The goal isn't to burn bridges. It's to build a door.

## The Financial Case (In Real Numbers)

Before investing any time or money in going independent, let's look at what you're actually paying for the convenience of a platform.

### Scenario: Mid-Career Tutor on Preply

| Metric | Platform | Independent |
|---|---|---|
| Hourly rate | £30 | £28 (discounted to attract) |
| Lessons per week | 20 | 20 |
| Monthly gross | £2,400 | £2,240 |
| Commission (25%) | -£600 | £0 |
| Payment processing (3%) | Included | -£67 |
| Tools (booking/reminders) | Included | -£15 |
| **Monthly take-home** | **£1,800** | **£2,158** |
| **Annual difference** | | **+£4,296** |

Even charging *less* than your platform rate, you earn more independently. And this assumes the 25% Preply rate — at 33% (the rate for newer tutors), the savings are even more dramatic.

Most independent tutors can charge the same or more than their platform rate because students also save money. On Preply, a £30/hr tutor costs the student approximately £35-40 after Preply's student-side fees. At £30 direct, the student pays less and the tutor earns more.

## The Toolkit: What You Actually Need

### 1. A Professional Booking Page

This is the single most important piece of infrastructure. Students need a place to see your availability and book lessons.

**Options:**

| Tool | Cost | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| [TutorLingua](/signup) | Free tier available | Built for tutors, handles payments + reminders | Newer platform |
| Calendly | Free–£12/mo | Well-known, reliable | No payment integration on free tier |
| Acuity Scheduling | £14/mo | Robust, customisable | Can be complex to set up |
| Google Calendar + form | Free | Zero cost | Manual, unprofessional |

The key requirement: students should be able to see your availability and book a slot without sending you a message and waiting for a reply. If someone has to email you, they'll go back to the platform.

### 2. Payment Processing

You need to collect money reliably and professionally.

**Stripe** is the standard recommendation across tutor communities. It handles cards, bank transfers, and recurring payments. Fees are typically 1.4% + 20p per transaction in the UK (2.9% + 30¢ in the US).

**PayPal** works but has higher fees (2.9% + 30p) and a less professional checkout experience.

**Bank transfer** is free but creates friction. Useful for trusted long-term students but not scalable.

[TutorLingua](/signup) integrates Stripe automatically — students pay when they book, and the money goes directly to your connected Stripe account.

### 3. Video Conferencing

If you're already teaching online, you have this covered. The most popular options:

**Zoom** — Industry standard. Free tier allows 40-minute meetings (sufficient for many lessons). Pro plan at £12/mo removes the limit.

**Google Meet** — Free with a Google account. Simple, reliable, no software install required.

**Whereby** — Browser-based, professional-looking rooms with a custom URL. Free tier for 1-on-1 calls.

### 4. Automated Reminders

Student no-shows cost time and money. Automated reminders reduce no-shows by 30-50%.

Most booking systems (Calendly, TutorLingua) include email and/or SMS reminders. Set up reminders at:
- 24 hours before the lesson
- 1 hour before the lesson

If your booking system doesn't include reminders, Google Calendar's built-in notifications are a free fallback.

### 5. Student Management (Optional but Recommended)

Once you have 10+ direct students, you'll want to track:
- Lesson history and notes
- Payment status
- Package balances
- Student progress

A simple spreadsheet works initially. As you grow, a purpose-built system like [TutorLingua](/signup) handles this automatically — tracking lessons, managing packages, and maintaining student records in one place.

## Finding Students Without a Platform

This is the question that holds most tutors back. The platform provides students; without it, where do they come from?

The answer from experienced independent tutors: **multiple channels, with referrals as the primary engine.**

### Channel 1: Referrals (60%+ of New Students)

Your existing students are your best marketing channel. They know your teaching quality, they trust you, and their recommendation carries weight.

**How to activate referrals:**
- Simply ask: "Do you know anyone else who might be looking for English lessons?"
- Offer a small incentive: "If you refer a friend who books, you both get a free lesson"
- Make it easy: send them a link to your booking page they can forward

### Channel 2: Social Media (20-25%)

You don't need to become a content creator. A simple, consistent presence on one or two platforms is enough.

**Instagram** works well for language tutors — short teaching tips, vocabulary posts, behind-the-scenes content. Even 2-3 posts per week can generate inquiries.

**Facebook groups** are goldmines. Independent ESL teacher groups, language-specific communities, and local expat groups are all places where potential students ask for tutor recommendations.

### Channel 3: Google (10-15%)

Set up a **Google Business Profile** for your tutoring service. It's free and shows up in local searches. Even online-only tutors benefit from appearing in "English tutor near me" searches.

Basic SEO helps too — a simple website or profile page that ranks for "[language] tutor [your specialisation]" can generate steady inbound inquiries.

### Channel 4: Content Marketing (5-10%)

Writing blog posts, creating YouTube videos, or producing educational content positions you as an expert and attracts students who already trust your knowledge.

This is a slow channel — it takes months to build — but it compounds over time and generates the highest-quality leads.

## The Transition Playbook

Here's the step-by-step process tutors recommend for going independent without losing your existing business:

### Month 1: Build Your Infrastructure
- Set up a booking page with payment processing
- Create a simple website or landing page
- Test the entire booking flow yourself

### Month 2: Test with New Students
- Start directing any new, non-platform student inquiries to your booking page
- If you get referral requests, send them to your direct booking link
- Iron out any issues in the booking/payment flow

### Month 3: Approach Your First Platform Student
- Choose your most trusted, longest-standing student
- Have the conversation: "I'm offering direct booking now. You'd pay £X instead of £Y on [platform], and we can continue exactly as we are."
- If they're interested, transition them. If not, no pressure.

### Month 4+: Gradual Shift
- Approach 1-2 more platform students per month
- Keep your platform profile active for new student acquisition
- Track the split: what percentage of your income comes from each channel?

### Month 12: Review
- By now, you should have 40-60% of your students on direct booking
- Your platform income is supplementary, not essential
- You've saved thousands in commission

## The Bottom Line

Going independent isn't about rejecting platforms. It's about having options.

A tutor with a direct booking system, a referral pipeline, and a social media presence is fundamentally more resilient than one who depends entirely on an algorithm they don't control.

The tools exist. The playbook is proven. The only thing between you and a commission-free business is the decision to start building.
