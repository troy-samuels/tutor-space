quickAnswer: "The Matthew Effect on tutoring platforms means top-reviewed tutors get more visibility, which brings more students and reviews, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. New tutors face an uphill battle because the algorithm favours those who already have social proof."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Tutoring platforms operate on a winner-take-all model where top tutors get disproportionate visibility"
  - "The algorithm creates a feedback loop: more reviews → higher ranking → more students → more reviews"
  - "New tutors on Preply often report position drops after an initial 'boost' period expires"
  - "One negative review early on can set back a new tutor's progress by weeks or months"
  - "The smart strategy is using platforms to get your first 5-10 regular students, then building outside them"
faqs:
  - question: "What is the Matthew Effect in online tutoring?"
    answer: "The Matthew Effect is the principle that 'the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.' On tutoring platforms like Preply and iTalki, tutors with more reviews and higher ratings get better visibility in search results, which brings more students, which generates more reviews — creating a self-reinforcing cycle that makes it increasingly difficult for new tutors to compete."
  - question: "How does Preply's algorithm rank tutors?"
    answer: "While Preply doesn't publicly disclose its exact algorithm, tutor communities have identified key ranking factors: number of completed lessons, average review score, response time, trial lesson conversion rate, booking rate, cancellation rate, and schedule availability. New tutors receive a temporary visibility boost that expires after a few weeks."
  - question: "Why can't new tutors get students on Preply?"
    answer: "New tutors face a cold-start problem: they need reviews to rank well, but they need students to get reviews. After Preply's initial boost period expires, new tutors without significant review volume often see their visibility drop dramatically. Some report their profile position showing 1-5 in the dashboard while receiving zero views."
  - question: "How can new tutors break through on tutoring platforms?"
    answer: "Strategies include: pricing competitively during your first 50 lessons to maximise trial conversions, responding to student inquiries within minutes, offering a standout trial lesson experience, and asking satisfied students for reviews. The long-term strategy is using the platform for discovery while building your own booking system for retention."
  - question: "Should tutors depend on a single platform for all their income?"
    answer: "No. Experienced tutors consistently advise against platform dependency. The recommended approach is using marketplaces to acquire your first 5-10 regular students, then diversifying to direct booking, social media marketing, and referrals. Having multiple income channels protects against algorithm changes and platform policy shifts."

## The Winner-Take-All Problem

In the Bible's Gospel of Matthew, there's a parable that ends with: "For to everyone who has, more will be given... but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away."

Sociologists call this the Matthew Effect. And it perfectly describes what's happening on tutoring platforms right now.

If you've ever wondered why some tutors on Preply or iTalki seem to have endless students while others can barely fill a single trial lesson — this is why.

---

## How the Feedback Loop Works

The mechanics are simple, and they're brutal:

1. **Tutor gets early students** (through pricing, luck, or the platform's initial boost)
2. **Students leave reviews** (high volume, mostly positive)
3. **Algorithm ranks tutor higher** (reviews are a primary signal)
4. **Higher ranking = more visibility** (top of search results)
5. **More visibility = more students** (and the cycle repeats)

The inverse is equally true. A tutor who struggles to get their first few students can't generate reviews, can't climb the ranking, and remains invisible in search results. The algorithm has no reason to show students a tutor with zero social proof when there's one with 200 five-star reviews right above them.

This isn't a bug. It's the system working exactly as designed.

### The Numbers Tell the Story

A tutor community analysis of Preply's visible search results found the following pattern:

| Position | Avg. Reviews | Avg. Rating | Price Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| Top 10 | 150+ | 4.9-5.0 | £25-45/hr |
| 11-25 | 50-149 | 4.7-4.9 | £20-35/hr |
| 26-50 | 15-49 | 4.5-4.9 | £15-30/hr |
| 50+ | 0-14 | Variable | £10-25/hr |

Notice the pattern. The tutors at the top don't just have more reviews — they have *dramatically* more. The gap between position 10 and position 50 isn't gradual. It's a cliff.

## The New Tutor Experience

Here's what new tutors across Reddit communities describe happening in their first few months on Preply:

**Week 1-2: The Honeymoon.** Preply gives new profiles a temporary visibility boost. Trial lessons come in. You feel optimistic. The platform works!

**Week 3-4: The Cliff.** The boost expires. Trial requests slow to a trickle. Your profile position, which showed "1-5" in the dashboard, now gets zero views. You check the metrics page obsessively.

**Month 2-3: The Grind.** You lower your price. You expand your availability to all hours. You message students who viewed your profile. Some of these tactics work temporarily, but the fundamental problem remains — you don't have enough reviews to compete.

**Month 4+: The Decision.** Tutors either stick it out (requiring persistence and low rates for an extended period), or they conclude the platform "doesn't work" and leave.

What's particularly frustrating is that this experience has nothing to do with teaching quality. A brilliant tutor with zero reviews is invisible to the algorithm. A mediocre tutor with 200 reviews gets a steady stream of new students.

### Dashboard vs Reality

One of the most reported frustrations is the disconnect between Preply's dashboard metrics and actual experience. Multiple tutors report their profile showing an "average position" of 1-5 while receiving zero profile views and zero trial requests.

This suggests the position metric either measures something different from what tutors assume, or the displayed position doesn't translate to actual student-facing visibility in the way the dashboard implies.

## Why Platforms Don't Fix This

The Matthew Effect isn't a problem for the platform — it's a feature.

From Preply's or iTalki's perspective, the algorithm is working perfectly:

- **Students get matched with proven tutors.** High-review tutors have social proof, reducing student risk.
- **Conversion rates stay high.** Students booking top-reviewed tutors are more likely to continue.
- **Platform revenue is maximised.** Top tutors teach more hours, generating more commission.

The new tutor's inability to break through isn't the platform's concern. There's always a fresh supply of new tutors signing up, providing the illusion of choice and keeping established tutors from getting complacent.

## What the Community Recommends

Across hundreds of threads in tutor communities, the advice for dealing with platform algorithms converges on a few key strategies:

### For New Tutors: The Sprint Strategy

If you're just starting on a platform, the first 50 lessons are everything. During this window:

**Price below market temporarily.** Not rock-bottom (that signals desperation), but 10-20% below comparable tutors. Your goal is volume, not margin.

**Perfect your trial lesson.** This is the highest-leverage 30 minutes in your business. Have a structured, engaging trial that demonstrates clear value. End with specific next steps.

**Respond instantly.** Response time is a confirmed ranking factor. Enable notifications and reply to student inquiries within minutes, not hours.

**Request reviews directly.** After every positive lesson, ask. Most students are happy to leave a review but won't think to do it unless prompted.

### For Established Tutors: The Diversification Strategy

If you're already on a platform with 50+ reviews, the smarter play is reducing your dependency on it:

**Use the platform for discovery, not delivery.** Think of Preply or iTalki as your marketing channel, not your business. The platform finds you students. Your job is to build a relationship strong enough that the student stays regardless of the platform.

**Build something outside the platform.** A booking page, a simple website, a Google Business profile, an Instagram presence — anything that generates student inquiries independently of the algorithm.

**Move repeat students to direct booking.** Long-term students who've been with you for months don't need the platform anymore. They know you, they trust you, and they'd rather not pay the platform's markup either. A tool like [TutorLingua](/signup) makes this transition simple — professional booking pages, payment processing, and automated reminders without building anything from scratch.

**Keep the platform for new student acquisition.** Don't close your platform profile entirely. Instead, use it as one of several channels. When a new student finds you on Preply, your goal is to deliver such a good experience that they become a long-term direct client.

## The Platform as Stepping Stone

The tutors who navigate the Matthew Effect most successfully are those who treat platforms as a stepping stone, not a destination.

Here's the framework that communities consistently endorse:

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Get your first 10 regulars.** Use the platform aggressively. Accept trials you'd normally skip. Price competitively. Build your review base.

**Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Start building your infrastructure.** Set up a professional booking page. Create a simple web presence. Start an email list of your students. Begin tracking which students came from the platform versus other channels.

**Phase 3 (Year 2+): Shift the balance.** Gradually move repeat students to direct booking. Reduce your platform availability. Focus new marketing efforts on channels you control — social media, referrals, content.

The goal isn't to rage-quit Preply. It's to build a business where no single platform controls your income, your visibility, or your livelihood.

## The Bigger Picture

The Matthew Effect in tutoring platforms reflects a broader truth about marketplace economics: platforms are designed to serve the marketplace, not the individual vendor.

Preply needs some tutors to succeed spectacularly (to attract students and prove the model works), and it can afford for many tutors to fail quietly (there are always more signing up).

Understanding this doesn't make it fair. But it does make it predictable. And predictable problems have plannable solutions.

The tutors who build sustainable businesses aren't the ones who crack the algorithm. They're the ones who stop depending on it entirely.
