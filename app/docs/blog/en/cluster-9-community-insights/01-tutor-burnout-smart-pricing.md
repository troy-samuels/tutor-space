quickAnswer: "The most effective way to prevent tutor burnout is raising your rates so you can teach fewer hours while earning the same or more income — teaching 20 hours at a higher rate is more sustainable than 30 hours at a lower one."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Burnout in online tutoring usually stems from too many hours at too-low rates, not from teaching itself"
  - "Raising rates is counterintuitive but is the most cited burnout fix in tutor communities"
  - "Teaching 20 hours at £30/hr earns the same as 30 hours at £20/hr — with 10 fewer hours of work"
  - "Students who stay after a price increase are generally more committed and less draining"
  - "Platform commissions compound the problem — tutors work extra hours to compensate for fees"
faqs:
  - question: "Why do online tutors burn out so quickly?"
    answer: "Online tutors often burn out because they teach too many hours at rates that don't reflect their value. Back-to-back video calls for 6-8 hours daily, combined with admin work, lesson planning, and the emotional labour of maintaining energy, leads to exhaustion. Platform commissions of 15-33% mean tutors need even more hours to earn a livable income."
  - question: "How does raising tutoring rates prevent burnout?"
    answer: "Raising your rates allows you to teach fewer hours while earning the same income. For example, moving from £20/hr to £30/hr means you can drop from 30 hours to 20 hours per week with identical earnings. The students who remain after a price increase tend to be more committed and engaged, reducing the emotional drain of no-shows and disengaged learners."
  - question: "Won't I lose students if I raise my tutoring rates?"
    answer: "You will likely lose some students, but tutors consistently report that the students who leave were often the most demanding and least committed. The ones who stay value your teaching and are generally easier to work with. Most tutors who raise rates report earning the same or more within 2-3 months."
  - question: "What is a sustainable number of tutoring hours per week?"
    answer: "Most experienced tutors recommend 15-25 teaching hours per week as sustainable long-term. This allows time for lesson preparation, admin, marketing, and personal recovery. Teaching beyond 25 hours consistently leads to diminished lesson quality and eventual burnout."
  - question: "How do platform commissions contribute to tutor burnout?"
    answer: "Platforms like Preply take 18-33% commission on every lesson. A tutor charging $30/hour on Preply may only receive $20-25 after fees. To earn the same take-home pay as an independent tutor, they need to teach 20-40% more hours — directly increasing burnout risk."

## The Quiet Crisis in Online Tutoring

There's a thread that appears in tutoring communities every few weeks, almost like clockwork. It goes something like this: "I'm teaching 30 hours a week and I'm exhausted. How do you manage burnout?"

The replies are always well-meaning. Meditate. Exercise. Take a holiday. Set boundaries.

But the most useful advice — the one that actually fixes the problem — is almost always buried halfway down the thread. It's not about self-care at all.

**It's about money.**

## Why Tutors Actually Burn Out

The mainstream narrative around burnout focuses on emotional exhaustion, overwork, and the need for better "work-life balance." And yes, teaching back-to-back video calls for six hours straight is genuinely draining.

But when you dig into what tutors are actually saying in communities like r/OnlineESLTeaching, r/Preply, and independent Facebook groups, a different picture emerges. The burnout isn't coming from teaching itself. It's coming from teaching **too many hours at rates that don't reflect their value**.

One tutor described it perfectly in a recent burnout thread: they loved teaching. They loved their students. What they couldn't sustain was the volume — 30+ hours a week of live lessons, plus preparation time, plus admin, plus the constant anxiety of maintaining their platform ranking.

The maths tells the story. At £20 per hour on a platform that takes 25% commission, you're actually earning £15 per hour. To make £2,000 per month, you need to teach 133 hours — roughly 33 hours per week. That's a full-time job with zero time for anything else.

### The Commission Multiplier

Platform commissions don't just reduce your income — they multiply your working hours. Here's how the maths works:

| Hourly Rate | Commission | Take-Home | Hours for £2,000/mo |
|---|---|---|---|
| £25 | 33% (Preply new) | £16.75 | 30 hrs/week |
| £25 | 15% (iTalki) | £21.25 | 24 hrs/week |
| £25 | 0% (Direct) | £25.00 | 20 hrs/week |

The difference between 30 hours and 20 hours per week isn't just 10 hours. It's the difference between chronic exhaustion and having time to actually live your life.

## The Fix Nobody Wants to Hear

In online tutor communities, the most counterintuitive advice is consistently the most effective: **raise your rates**.

This comes up again and again in discussion threads. Tutors who've been through burnout and come out the other side almost universally point to pricing as the turning point. Not meditation. Not time management apps. Not scheduling software. Pricing.

The logic is straightforward. If you charge £30 per hour instead of £20, you can teach 20 hours instead of 30 and earn the same income. That's 10 fewer hours per week of back-to-back video calls. Ten fewer hours of maintaining energy, preparing materials, and managing students.

### What Actually Happens When You Raise Rates

Tutors who've done it report a consistent pattern:

**Week 1-2:** Anxiety. You expect everyone to leave.

**Week 3-4:** Some students leave. Usually the ones who were most price-sensitive, most likely to cancel last minute, and least engaged in lessons.

**Month 2-3:** Your remaining students are more committed. They show up prepared. They don't cancel as often. Your lessons are better because you're not exhausted.

**Month 4+:** You start attracting a different type of student — ones who associate higher prices with higher quality. Your booking rate stabilises at or above previous levels.

The students who stay after a price increase are, almost universally, the ones tutors describe as "a pleasure to teach." The ones who leave were often the source of the most stress.

## The Psychology of Undercharging

If raising rates is so effective, why don't more tutors do it?

The answer lies in how tutoring platforms condition their tutors. Marketplaces like Preply and iTalki create an environment where tutors compete primarily on price. The algorithm rewards lower prices with better visibility. Trial lessons are often discounted or free. The implicit message is clear: your value is determined by how cheaply you can offer your time.

This creates a race to the bottom that platforms profit from but tutors suffer through. A tutor who charges £15 per hour and teaches 35 hours per week generates more commission revenue for the platform than one who charges £30 and teaches 20 hours.

The platform's incentives and the tutor's wellbeing are fundamentally misaligned.

### Breaking the Cycle

Breaking free from undercharging requires a mindset shift:

1. **Calculate your true hourly rate.** Include preparation time, admin, unpaid trial lessons, and platform commission. Most tutors discover their effective rate is 30-50% lower than their listed price.

2. **Define your floor.** What's the minimum hourly rate that allows you to teach 20-25 hours per week and meet your financial needs? That's your new baseline.

3. **Grandfather existing students.** Give current students advance notice (4-6 weeks) and apply the new rate to new students immediately. Many tutors offer existing students a smaller increase than new students.

4. **Stop competing on price.** Compete on quality, specialisation, results, and the student experience instead.

## The Platform Trap

There's a reason burnout discussions are particularly common in platform-specific subreddits. Marketplaces create several burnout-accelerating conditions:

**The availability trap.** Platforms reward tutors who are available at all hours. The algorithm favours those with wide-open schedules, creating pressure to be perpetually online.

**The review trap.** Every lesson is a potential review. The emotional labour of performing at your best for every single session — even when you're exhausted — is relentless.

**The commission trap.** As we've seen, commissions force tutors to work more hours to earn the same take-home pay.

**The algorithm trap.** If your booking rate drops, your ranking drops, which means fewer bookings, which means lower income, which means more anxiety and more hours trying to compensate.

Independent tutors — those who take bookings directly through their own systems — report significantly lower burnout rates. Not because teaching is easier, but because they've removed the amplifiers.

## A Practical Burnout Prevention Plan

Based on what hundreds of tutors across Reddit and Facebook communities consistently recommend:

### Step 1: Audit Your Numbers (This Week)

Calculate your true hourly rate. Include everything — the 15-minute gaps between lessons, the lesson prep, the messages to students, the commission paid. Write down the real number.

### Step 2: Set Your Sustainable Rate (This Month)

Determine the rate that allows you to teach 20-25 hours per week and meet your financial needs. If that rate feels uncomfortably high, good — it probably means you've been undercharging.

### Step 3: Communicate the Change (Next Month)

Tell existing students with 4-6 weeks' notice. Be direct. Don't apologise. Something like: "I'm adjusting my rates to £X per hour starting [date]. I want to make sure I can continue delivering the best possible lessons."

### Step 4: Reduce Your Hours (Gradually)

As your new rate takes effect, start closing off time slots. Don't fill every cancelled lesson with a new booking. Protect your recovery time like you'd protect a client appointment.

### Step 5: Move Students Off-Platform (Over Time)

For long-term students, explore direct booking options. Every lesson taken off-platform is 15-33% more income for zero additional work. Tools like [TutorLingua](/signup) make this transition seamless — handling scheduling, payments, and reminders so you don't need to manage it all manually.

## The Bottom Line

Burnout in online tutoring isn't a wellness problem. It's a pricing problem.

The tutors who thrive long-term aren't the ones with the best meditation practice. They're the ones who charge what they're worth, teach a sustainable number of hours, and keep as much of their income as possible.

The communities know this. The advice is there in every burnout thread, buried under the well-meaning suggestions about yoga and screen breaks.

Raise your rates. Teach fewer hours. Keep more of your money. It's not complicated — it's just uncomfortable.

And that discomfort lasts a lot less than burnout does.
