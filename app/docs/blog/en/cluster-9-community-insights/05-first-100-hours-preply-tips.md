quickAnswer: "The first 100 hours on Preply are critical because new tutors receive a temporary algorithm boost that expires after a few weeks. Use this window to convert as many trial lessons as possible, build reviews quickly, price strategically (not too low), and understand the commission structure — which starts at 33% and drops to 25% then 18% only after significant lesson volume."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Preply gives new tutors a temporary visibility boost — your first 2-3 weeks are the most important for building momentum"
  - "Commission starts at 33% for new tutors and drops to 25% at certain thresholds, then 18% for high-volume tutors"
  - "Trial lessons are your highest-leverage activity — a structured, impressive 25-minute trial converts far better than a casual chat"
  - "Preply employees reportedly receive free lesson credits, which can result in students who never intended to become paying clients"
  - "The long-term strategy is to use Preply for student acquisition while building your own direct booking capability"
faqs:
  - question: "How does Preply's commission structure work?"
    answer: "Preply charges a tiered commission. New tutors pay 33% commission on all lessons. After reaching certain lesson volume thresholds (the exact numbers aren't publicly disclosed and may change), the rate drops to 25%, and eventually to 18% for high-volume tutors. This means a new tutor charging $30/hour actually receives only $20.10 per lesson. The commission applies to all lessons, including trials that convert to paid bookings."
  - question: "What is Preply's new tutor boost and how long does it last?"
    answer: "When you first create a Preply tutor profile, the platform gives your listing temporary increased visibility in search results. This 'boost' typically lasts 2-3 weeks, though the exact duration varies. During this period, you'll receive more profile views and trial requests than you will afterwards. This is your most critical window for building reviews and momentum — once it expires, your ranking depends on your review volume, conversion rate, and other algorithm factors."
  - question: "How should I price my first lessons on Preply?"
    answer: "Community wisdom suggests pricing 10-20% below comparable tutors in your niche during your first 50 lessons, but not going rock-bottom. Extremely low prices attract price-sensitive students who are less likely to become regulars, and they make it harder to raise rates later. A tutor with strong qualifications teaching English might start at $18-22/hour rather than the $25-30 they'll charge once established. The goal is volume — enough lessons to build reviews quickly."
  - question: "Why did my Preply bookings suddenly drop?"
    answer: "The most common cause is the expiration of the new tutor boost. After 2-3 weeks, your artificial visibility advantage ends and your ranking is determined by your actual metrics: review count, rating, response time, trial conversion rate, and booking consistency. Other causes include seasonal dips, algorithm updates, and changes to your availability settings. Tutors recommend checking your response time statistics and expanding availability during dips."
  - question: "Should I accept every trial lesson on Preply?"
    answer: "During your first 50 lessons, yes — almost always. Each trial is an opportunity to gain a review and a regular student. However, experienced tutors flag one exception: be cautious of students using employee free credits (some Preply employees reportedly receive complimentary lessons). These students may have no intention of continuing as paying clients. Signs include profiles with no clear learning goals and students who seem disengaged from the start."

## The 100-Hour Crucible

Ask any experienced Preply tutor what they'd tell their past self on day one, and you'll get an earful. Not because Preply is a bad platform — it works well for many tutors — but because the first few months are littered with invisible traps that the sign-up process doesn't mention.

Across Reddit threads, Facebook groups, and tutor forums, the same lessons come up repeatedly. Here's the crowdsourced wisdom from tutors who've been through it — condensed into everything you need to know before (and during) your first 100 hours.

---

## Phase 1: The Boost Period (Weeks 1-3)

### What's Happening Behind the Scenes

When you create a new Preply profile, you enter what the community calls the "boost period." Preply gives new tutors temporary increased visibility in search results — essentially a head start to help you get your first students and reviews.

This boost is real, and it's your single most valuable window. Tutors consistently report receiving significantly more profile views and trial requests during their first 2-3 weeks than at any point afterwards (unless they've built up hundreds of reviews).

**The critical mistake:** Many new tutors don't realise the boost is temporary. They see trial requests coming in and assume this is normal flow. When it stops after a few weeks, they think something broke. Nothing broke. The training wheels just came off.

### Maximising the Boost

During these first weeks, your only goal is conversion. Every trial student who becomes a regular is a review, a recurring booking, and a signal to the algorithm that you're worth showing to more students.

**Response time matters enormously.** Preply tracks how quickly you respond to student enquiries and trial requests. During the boost period, aim to respond within minutes, not hours. Enable push notifications. Check the app between lessons.

**Availability should be wide.** Open as many time slots as you can tolerate. The algorithm favours tutors with generous availability because it can match them with more students. You can tighten your schedule later — right now, you need volume.

**Accept nearly everything.** That trial request from a student whose level seems too basic? Take it. The booking at an awkward time? Accept it. You're building a foundation. Be selective later.

---

## Phase 2: The Trial Lesson (Your Highest-Leverage 25 Minutes)

The trial lesson is where new tutors most often succeed or fail — and it has nothing to do with teaching ability.

### What Works

Community advice on trial lessons is remarkably consistent:

**Have a structure.** Don't wing it. A 25-minute trial should have a clear flow: warm greeting and rapport-building (3 minutes), needs assessment (5 minutes), a mini-lesson demonstrating your teaching style (12 minutes), and a wrap-up with next steps (5 minutes).

**Assess *and* teach.** Pure assessment trials ("So tell me about yourself... what's your level?") are boring for students. They came to experience a lesson, not sit an interview. Include at least one moment where the student genuinely learns something new.

**End with specificity.** Don't finish with "So would you like to continue?" Instead, say something like: "Based on what we covered today, I think we should focus on [specific area] in our next lesson. I'd suggest we meet [frequency] to reach your goal by [timeframe]. Shall I set that up?" This gives the student a concrete reason to commit.

**Don't oversell.** Students can smell desperation. Confidence and competence sell better than enthusiasm and discounts.

### What Doesn't Work

**The casual chat.** Spending 25 minutes just talking gives the student no sense of what structured lessons would be like. It's pleasant but unconvincing.

**The grammar test.** Running through a level assessment form for the entire trial feels clinical and impersonal.

**Immediately offering discounts.** Some new tutors, anxious about conversion, offer discounts before the student has even expressed hesitation. This signals low confidence in your own value.

## Phase 3: Understanding the Commission Structure

This is where the maths gets painful.

### Preply's Commission Tiers

Preply's commission structure is tiered based on lesson volume. While the platform doesn't always publicise exact thresholds, tutor communities have mapped it out:

| Tier | Commission Rate | Your Take-Home (on $30/hr) | Approximate Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| New Tutor | 33% | $20.10 | First ~20 hours |
| Established | 25% | $22.50 | After significant volume |
| High Volume | 18% | $24.60 | Top-tier lesson count |

The jump from 33% to 25% represents a meaningful income increase — earning an extra $2.40 per hour on a $30 rate. But the path there requires sustained lesson volume, which creates a catch-22 for tutors who can't fill their schedule.

### The Real Impact

One tutor calculated their total Preply commission paid over 3.5 years: more than $9,300. That's not a fee — that's a salary. For context, that's roughly £7,500 that could have gone directly to the tutor.

At the new-tutor rate of 33%, teaching 20 hours per week at $25/hour, you'd pay Preply approximately $8,580 per year in commission. At the lowest tier of 18%, the same workload costs $4,680 per year. The difference — nearly $4,000 — is the cost of being new on the platform.

## Phase 4: The Post-Boost Reality (Weeks 4-12)

This is where most new tutors either push through or give up.

### The Visibility Drop

After the boost expires, trial requests slow significantly. Your dashboard might show a decent "average position," but actual profile views and enquiries tell a different story. This disconnect is one of the most discussed frustrations in Preply communities — tutors reporting position metrics of "1-5" while receiving zero views.

**Don't panic-discount.** The instinct to slash your price when bookings slow is strong but counterproductive. Dropping your rate attracts price-sensitive students who are less likely to stay long-term, and it's extremely difficult to raise rates once you've set a low baseline.

### Building Without the Boost

The tutors who break through the post-boost slump share common strategies:

**Invest in your profile.** A professional photo, a well-crafted video introduction, and detailed specialisation descriptions make your profile stand out when organic visibility is limited. Tutors report that updating their video alone increased trial request rates.

**Request reviews proactively.** After every positive lesson, ask your student to leave a review. Most students are happy to help but won't think to do it unprompted. Reviews are the single most important factor in long-term algorithm ranking.

**Specialise your listing.** Instead of offering "General English," create specific listings: "Business English for Professionals," "IELTS Speaking Preparation," or "Conversational English for Intermediate Learners." Specific listings convert better because students feel you're speaking directly to their needs.

## The Red Flags Experienced Tutors Watch For

Community discussions have flagged several warning signs that new tutors often miss:

### Employee Free Credits

A widely discussed thread revealed that Preply employees reportedly receive complimentary lesson credits. This means some trial students have no genuine intention of becoming paying clients — they're using a company perk for a free lesson.

Signs to watch for: profiles with no clear learning goals, students who seem unusually casual about the process, and trials that feel like the student is evaluating the platform experience rather than genuinely seeking a tutor.

This isn't reason to be suspicious of every trial student. But it's worth knowing that not every trial represents a potential long-term client.

### The Instant Cancellation Pattern

Some students book trials with multiple tutors simultaneously and cancel all but one. If you receive a trial booking that cancels within hours, this may be what happened. It's frustrating but normal — don't take it personally.

### Students Who Demand Off-Platform Communication

Preply's terms prohibit sharing personal contact details. While many tutors eventually move long-term students to direct booking, students who push for personal contact during the *trial* are sometimes scammers or individuals looking to circumvent the payment system without paying the tutor at all.

## The Long-Term Strategy: Platform as Stepping Stone

The most consistent advice from experienced Preply tutors isn't about cracking the algorithm. It's about outgrowing the need for it.

**Months 1-6:** Use Preply to build your student base. Accept the commission as a marketing cost. Focus on accumulating reviews and regular students.

**Months 7-12:** Begin building your off-platform presence. Set up a professional [booking page](/signup), start a social media presence, and ask satisfied students for referrals.

**Year 2+:** Transition willing long-term students to direct booking. Keep Preply for new student acquisition, but aim for a mix where no more than 50% of your income depends on any single platform.

The maths supports this approach. Moving just five students from Preply to direct booking at $25/hour, each taking one lesson per week, saves you between $975 and $2,145 per year in commission — depending on your tier.

## What Nobody Tells You on Sign-Up Day

Preply can be an excellent launchpad for a tutoring career. The platform has genuine reach, real students, and a functional infrastructure. But it's a launchpad — not a destination.

The tutors who build sustainable, well-paid careers are the ones who use the platform strategically, understand its incentive structures, and invest in their own independence from day one.

Your first 100 hours are the foundation. Make them count.
