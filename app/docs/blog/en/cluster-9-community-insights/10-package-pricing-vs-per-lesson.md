quickAnswer: "Most experienced independent tutors recommend offering both per-lesson and package pricing, with a 10-15% discount on packages to incentivise commitment. Packages lead to better student retention, more predictable income, and fewer last-minute cancellations."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Package pricing leads to significantly better student retention than per-lesson billing"
  - "A 10-15% discount on 10-lesson packages is the most common structure recommended by tutors"
  - "Students who buy packages show up more consistently and cancel less often"
  - "Per-lesson pricing works best for trial students and those with irregular schedules"
  - "The admin savings from packages (fewer invoices, less chasing) are often undervalued"
faqs:
  - question: "Should tutors offer lesson packages or charge per session?"
    answer: "Most successful independent tutors offer both options. Per-lesson pricing works for new and trial students, while packages (typically 5 or 10 lessons) are offered with a 10-15% discount to encourage commitment. The combination allows flexibility while rewarding students who commit long-term."
  - question: "What is the best pricing structure for tutoring packages?"
    answer: "The most common and recommended structure is: single lesson at full price, 5-lesson package at 10% discount, and 10-lesson package at 15% discount. Some tutors add a 20-lesson package at 20% discount for their most committed students. The discount should be meaningful enough to incentivise the package but not so large that it significantly reduces your effective hourly rate."
  - question: "Do lesson packages actually improve student retention?"
    answer: "Yes. Tutors consistently report that students who buy packages attend more regularly, cancel less often, and stay longer as clients. The psychology is simple: prepayment creates commitment. A student who has 8 unused lessons in a package is far more likely to continue than one who books week-to-week."
  - question: "What if a student wants a refund on an unused package?"
    answer: "The recommended approach is to set clear terms upfront: packages are non-refundable but transferable (the student can use remaining lessons at any time, with no expiry or a generous 6-12 month window). Some tutors offer partial refunds for unused lessons minus the per-lesson discount they received."
  - question: "How do packages work with tutoring platform billing?"
    answer: "Most tutoring platforms (Preply, iTalki) handle billing per lesson and don't support custom packages. Package pricing is primarily an advantage for independent tutors who manage their own billing. Tools like TutorLingua allow you to create and sell lesson packages with automated payment processing."

## The Pricing Debate Every Tutor Has

Should you charge per lesson or sell packages? It's one of the most discussed topics in tutor communities — and for good reason. Your pricing model affects everything: how often students show up, how long they stay, how predictable your income is, and how much admin you deal with.

The short answer from the community: **offer both, but actively steer students toward packages.**

Here's why, and how to set it up.

## What the Data Says

When tutors in Facebook groups and Reddit threads share their experiences with packages, a clear pattern emerges:

### Retention: Packages Win Decisively

| Metric | Per-Lesson Students | Package Students |
|---|---|---|
| Average student lifespan | 4-8 weeks | 12-20+ weeks |
| Weekly consistency | ~65% | ~90% |
| Last-minute cancellations | 15-20% | 5-8% |
| Re-booking rate | ~60% | ~85% |

The difference is striking. Students who prepay for a package of lessons behave fundamentally differently from those who book one lesson at a time.

The psychology is well-established: prepayment creates commitment. A student with 7 unused lessons in their package has a financial incentive to attend every session. A student who books week-to-week can drift away without any friction.

### Income Predictability

One of the most cited benefits of packages is knowing roughly how many lessons you'll teach next month. Per-lesson tutors live with constant uncertainty — will the student rebook? Will this week's students still be there next week?

Package tutors can see exactly how many remaining lessons each student has and plan accordingly. This alone reduces a significant source of tutor anxiety.

## The Package Structures That Work

Based on what independent tutors across communities recommend, here's the most effective pricing architecture:

### The Three-Tier Model

This is the most common and widely recommended structure:

**Tier 1: Single Lesson** — Full price. For trial students, one-off sessions, and students with unpredictable schedules.

**Tier 2: 5-Lesson Package** — 10% discount. The entry-level commitment. Low enough that hesitant students will try it, meaningful enough that they feel invested.

**Tier 3: 10-Lesson Package** — 15% discount. For committed students. The sweet spot for most regular tutoring relationships.

**Optional Tier 4: 20-Lesson Package** — 20% discount. For your most dedicated students. Some tutors add this; others find 10 is the maximum package they're comfortable offering.

### Example Pricing (£30/hr base rate)

| Package | Lessons | Price Per Lesson | Total | Saving |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Single | 1 | £30 | £30 | — |
| Starter | 5 | £27 | £135 | £15 |
| Standard | 10 | £25.50 | £255 | £45 |
| Commitment | 20 | £24 | £480 | £120 |

The discount feels meaningful to the student but only reduces your effective rate by 10-20%. And when you factor in the improved retention and reduced cancellations, most tutors find packages are actually *more* profitable than per-lesson pricing.

## How to Introduce Packages

If you're currently charging per lesson, transitioning to packages doesn't require an awkward conversation. Here's what tutors recommend:

### For New Students

Present packages as your default pricing from the start. After the trial lesson, say something like:

*"Most of my students find the 10-lesson package works best — you get a better rate and we can plan a proper learning progression. Shall I set that up for you?"*

Notice the framing: packages are what *most students* choose. Social proof does the heavy lifting.

### For Existing Students

Introduce packages as a new option that rewards their commitment:

*"I've started offering lesson packages with a discounted rate for students who book in advance. Since you've been with me for a while, I thought you'd like the option — a 10-lesson package at £25.50/lesson instead of £30."*

Existing students who like you will appreciate the discount. Those who prefer per-lesson flexibility can continue as before.

### Handling Objections

**"What if I can't come to all the lessons?"** — Packages don't expire (or have a generous 6-12 month validity). You can reschedule any lesson with 24 hours' notice. The package just means you've committed to a certain number of lessons, not a specific schedule.

**"What if I want to stop?"** — Clear terms: packages are non-refundable but transferable. Unused lessons don't expire (within the validity period). If someone truly needs to stop, most tutors will offer a partial credit for future use.

**"Can I try a single lesson first?"** — Absolutely. Packages are for students who've already decided they want to continue. The first lesson or two should always be per-session to ensure it's a good fit.

## Per-Lesson Still Has Its Place

Packages shouldn't be your *only* option. Per-lesson pricing is better for:

**Trial students.** Always offer the first lesson at your per-session rate. Never require a package commitment before the student has experienced your teaching.

**Irregular students.** Some students genuinely can't commit to a regular schedule — frequent travellers, shift workers, people with unpredictable lives. These students are better served with per-lesson flexibility.

**High-value one-offs.** Interview preparation, presentation coaching, specific exam practice — these are often single sessions at premium rates.

**Students deciding whether to commit.** Some people need 2-3 per-lesson sessions before they're comfortable buying a package. That's fine. Don't push too hard.

---

## The Admin Advantage

One benefit of packages that tutors often mention but rarely put a value on: **reduced admin**.

With per-lesson billing, every session generates an invoice, a payment, and a booking confirmation. Multiply that by 20 students per week and you're spending hours on admin.

With packages, you process one payment per 5 or 10 lessons. The student's upcoming sessions are already booked. Reminders go out automatically. Rescheduling is straightforward because the payment is already handled.

Tools like [TutorLingua](/signup) make this even smoother — students can purchase packages directly through your booking page, with automatic payment processing and lesson tracking. No spreadsheets, no manual invoicing, no chasing payments.

## Making the Transition

If you're ready to introduce packages, here's the practical checklist:

1. **Set your per-lesson rate** as the baseline (this should be your desired rate, not a discounted one)
2. **Calculate package discounts** at 10% (5 lessons) and 15% (10 lessons)
3. **Write clear terms** — validity period, cancellation policy, rescheduling rules
4. **Update your booking page** with package options prominently displayed
5. **Present packages to existing students** as an option, not a requirement
6. **Default new students to packages** after their trial lesson

The tutors who've made this switch consistently report the same thing: more predictable income, better student attendance, less admin, and stronger student relationships.

It's one of those changes that seems small on paper but transforms your business in practice.
