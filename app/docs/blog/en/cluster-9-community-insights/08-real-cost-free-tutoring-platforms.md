quickAnswer: "Tutoring platforms take 15-33% commission on every lesson. A tutor teaching 80 lessons per month at $30/hour on Preply at the 25% tier loses approximately $600/month — over $7,000 per year. One tutor calculated over $9,300 paid to Preply across 3.5 years of part-time teaching."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Preply's commission ranges from 33% (new tutors) to 18% (after 400+ hours taught)"
  - "iTalki and Verbling charge a flat 15% commission on all lessons"
  - "One part-time tutor calculated they paid over $9,300 to Preply across 3.5 years"
  - "Commission is charged on EVERY lesson — including the 100th lesson with the same student"
  - "The 'cost of discovery' argument breaks down once students become regulars"
faqs:
  - question: "How much commission does Preply take from tutors?"
    answer: "Preply uses a tiered commission structure: 33% for new tutors (first 20 hours), 25% for tutors who have taught 20-400 hours, and 18% for tutors with 400+ hours. This means a new tutor charging $30/hour only receives $20.10 per lesson. Even at the best tier, they lose $5.40 per lesson."
  - question: "How much commission does iTalki take from tutors?"
    answer: "iTalki charges a flat 15% commission on all lessons for professional teachers and community tutors. Unlike Preply, this rate doesn't change based on hours taught. On a $30 lesson, the tutor receives $25.50."
  - question: "How much money do tutors lose to platform fees over a year?"
    answer: "A full-time tutor teaching 80 lessons/month at $30/hour on Preply at the 25% commission tier loses approximately $600/month or $7,200/year. Part-time tutors (40 lessons/month) at the same rate lose approximately $3,600/year. Over a 3-5 year career, total commission paid can reach $15,000-35,000."
  - question: "Are tutoring platform commissions fair?"
    answer: "Platform commissions are defensible for initial student acquisition — the platform invests in marketing, advertising, and infrastructure to connect tutors with students. The controversy arises because the same commission rate applies to every subsequent lesson, even after years of weekly sessions. The platform's ongoing contribution to a long-term student relationship is minimal, but the fee remains."
  - question: "How can tutors avoid paying platform commissions?"
    answer: "Tutors can reduce commission costs by: transitioning long-term students to direct booking through their own system (keeping the platform for new student discovery), building independent marketing channels (social media, referrals, content), and using commission-free tools like TutorLingua for scheduling and payments."

## The Price of "Free"

Every tutoring platform pitches the same story: "Join for free. We bring you students. You teach."

What they don't put in the headline: **we take 15-33% of everything you earn. Forever.**

In tutor communities on Reddit and Facebook, the commission conversation isn't theoretical. Tutors share real numbers — monthly deductions, annual totals, and career-spanning calculations that reveal the true cost of platform convenience.

The numbers are eye-opening.

## The Commission Breakdown

Let's start with what each major platform actually charges:

### Platform Commission Rates (2026)

| Platform | Rate | Structure | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Preply** | 18-33% | Tiered by hours | 33% for first 20hrs, 25% for 20-400hrs, 18% for 400+hrs |
| **iTalki** | 15% | Flat | Same rate regardless of experience |
| **Verbling** | 15% | Flat | Same rate regardless of experience |
| **Cambly** | Fixed ~$10.20/hr | Fixed rate | No commission per se, but tutors can't set their own price |

The structure matters. On Preply, new tutors — who are already struggling to get their first students and build reviews — pay the highest rate. By the time they've taught 400+ hours and reduced their commission to 18%, they've already paid thousands in fees during their most vulnerable period.

## What Tutors Actually Pay: Real Numbers

Here's where the community's honesty makes things uncomfortable for platforms.

### Story 1: $9,300 Over 3.5 Years

One tutor on r/Preply calculated their total commission paid across 3.5 years of part-time teaching. The number: **over $9,300**. For context, that's enough to:
- Fund a year of professional development
- Cover six months of a booking system subscription
- Pay for a complete website and marketing setup
- Represent the down payment on a business expansion

And this was a part-time tutor. Full-time tutors teaching 25+ hours per week could easily double or triple that figure.

### Story 2: The Monthly Reality Check

A mid-career tutor on Preply shared their monthly breakdown:

| Metric | Amount |
|---|---|
| Lessons taught | 72 |
| Listed hourly rate | $35 |
| Gross monthly earnings | $2,520 |
| Commission (25%) | -$630 |
| **Take-home** | **$1,890** |

$630 per month. $7,560 per year. And this is at the 25% tier — not even the 33% that new tutors face.

### Story 3: The Free Credits Problem

In a revelatory thread, a tutor posted that Preply employees receive free credits for trial lessons. This means the free or discounted trial lessons that tutors provide as an investment in acquiring new students are sometimes consumed by platform employees exploring the product — not by potential long-term clients.

The thread generated significant discussion about how platforms' internal incentives can misalign with tutor interests.

## The "Cost of Doing Business" Argument

Platforms defend commissions as the "cost of student acquisition." And to be fair, there's merit to this argument — for the first student, and maybe the second.

The platform invests heavily in Google ads, social media marketing, app development, and brand building. That investment reaches potential students who would never have found an individual tutor on their own. A 25-33% commission on that first connection isn't unreasonable.

But here's where the argument breaks down: **the same commission applies to lesson number 200 with the same student.**

Consider a tutor who's been teaching the same student every week for two years. The platform connected them once, 104 lessons ago. The platform hasn't done anything to maintain that relationship — no new value, no additional marketing, no ongoing service that benefits the specific student-tutor pair.

Yet the commission continues. Every. Single. Week.

### The Maths of Diminishing Value

| Lesson # | Platform's Value Add | Commission Paid |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (Trial) | High — student discovery | $8.75 (25% of $35) |
| 2-10 | Medium — platform infrastructure | $78.75 |
| 11-50 | Low — student already committed | $350.00 |
| 51-100 | Minimal — relationship is independent | $437.50 |
| 101-200 | Near zero — pure habit | $875.00 |
| **Total over 200 lessons** | | **$1,750** |

The tutor has paid $1,750 in commission for a single student relationship. The platform's contribution to lessons 51-200 is essentially hosting the video call and processing the payment — services that cost a fraction of what's being charged.

## The Emotional Cost

The financial impact is quantifiable. The emotional cost is harder to measure but equally real.

Tutors in communities describe:

**The "check" moment.** Seeing your earnings page and doing the mental subtraction. The gap between what you charged and what you received. This happens after every lesson.

**The comparison.** Knowing that a colleague teaching the same student directly takes home 100% of the fee. Every shared rate card is a reminder.

**The trap feeling.** Wanting to leave but fearing the loss of your student base, your reviews, your ranking. The platform becomes a golden cage — the very thing keeping you afloat is also the thing draining your income.

**The resentment cycle.** Frustration at commissions leads to working more hours, which leads to burnout, which leads to lower lesson quality, which leads to lower bookings, which leads to more frustration.

---

## When Tutors Snap

Every tutor has a breaking point. In community threads, these are the moments that trigger the shift to independence:

**The annual calculation.** Sitting down with a spreadsheet and seeing a five-figure lifetime commission total.

**A policy change.** The platform changing commission rates, trial lesson policies, or algorithm rules without warning.

**A student asking.** "Can we just do this directly? I'd pay you the same and you'd keep more." When the student suggests it first, the fear of asking disappears.

**A colleague's success.** Seeing another tutor successfully transition to direct booking and sharing the experience in a community thread.

## The Way Out

If you've reached your breaking point — or you're approaching it — the solution isn't to rage-quit the platform. It's to build alternatives methodically:

### Step 1: Know Your Numbers

Use our [Platform Receipt tool](/receipt) to calculate exactly what you've paid in commission. The number might shock you. That shock is useful — it's motivation.

### Step 2: Set Up Direct Booking

You need a booking page, payment processing, and automated reminders. [TutorLingua](/signup) provides all three, specifically designed for language tutors. The free tier means you can start without any financial risk.

### Step 3: Start with Your Most Trusted Student

Choose the student you've been teaching longest. Have an honest conversation: "I'm offering direct booking now. You'd pay [slightly less] and I'd earn [significantly more]. We can continue exactly as we are."

Most students are receptive. Many are relieved — they've been paying the platform's markup too.

### Step 4: Gradually Shift the Balance

Move 1-2 students per month to direct booking. Keep the platform profile active for new student acquisition. Track the split. Within 6-12 months, your direct income should be significant enough that the platform is a channel, not a dependency.

---

## The Bottom Line

Tutoring platforms aren't evil. They solve a genuine problem — connecting tutors with students who'd never find them otherwise.

But the commission model is designed for the platform's benefit, not the tutor's. The value exchange is fair for student acquisition and unfair for student retention.

You don't have to accept that trade-off forever.
