  - question: "What questions should I ask in a trial language lesson?"
    answer: "Essential questions: 'What made you decide to start learning now?', 'What's your #1 goal with this language?', 'Have you tried learning before—what worked?', 'What's your biggest frustration?', and 'How much time can you dedicate weekly?' These reveal motivation, goals, and commitment level."
  - question: "How long should a trial tutoring lesson be?"
    answer: "Trial lessons work best at 25-30 minutes. This provides enough time for introductions (5 min), discovery questions (10 min), a mini-lesson demonstration (10 min), and next steps discussion (5 min). Longer trials risk overwhelming students before they commit."
  - question: "How do I convert trial lesson students to paying clients?"
    answer: "Focus on understanding their goals deeply, demonstrate your teaching style with a relevant mini-lesson, show enthusiasm for their success, and end with a clear call-to-action. Ask: 'Based on your goals, I recommend we start with X sessions focusing on Y. Would you like to book your first regular lesson?'"
  - question: "What's a good trial lesson conversion rate for tutors?"
    answer: "Top tutors convert 60-80% of trial students to paying clients. If your conversion is below 40%, review your trial structure: Are you asking enough discovery questions? Demonstrating value clearly? Making booking easy? Often low conversion stems from insufficient personalization."
  - question: "Should tutors charge for trial lessons?"
    answer: "Both approaches work: free trials generate more bookings but attract some uncommitted students; paid trials ($5-15) filter for serious learners. Start with free trials to build reviews, then switch to low-cost paid trials once you have established credibility and demand."

# Best Questions to Ask in a Trial Language Lesson

The best questions to ask in a trial language lesson are: **"What made you decide to start learning now?"**, **"What's the #1 thing you want to be able to do in this language?"**, **"Have you tried learning before—what worked and what didn't?"**, **"What's your biggest frustration with language learning?"**, and **"How much time can you realistically dedicate each week?"** These 12 discovery questions help you understand student needs, demonstrate your expertise, and convert 60-80% of trials into paying students. Here's exactly when and how to ask each one.

## Why the Right Questions Transform Trial Conversions

Most tutors treat trial lessons as mini-versions of regular lessons. They teach grammar, do conversation practice, and hope the student likes them enough to book more.

This approach converts maybe 30-40% of trials.

**The problem:** Students don't buy lessons—they buy progress toward a goal. If you don't understand their goal deeply, you can't show them how you'll help them achieve it.

**The solution:** Spend 15-20 minutes of your trial asking strategic questions. When done right, you'll:
- Understand exactly what the student wants
- Position yourself as the solution to their specific problem
- Build rapport that generic lessons can't match
- Create a custom plan they can visualize succeeding with

Tutors who master discovery questions report **60-80% trial conversion rates**—double the industry average.

## The 12 Best Trial Lesson Questions

### Phase 1: Understanding Their "Why" (5 minutes)

#### 1. "What made you decide to start learning [language] now?"

**Why It Works:** The word "now" is key. It reveals the trigger event that pushed them from "I should learn Spanish someday" to "I'm booking a trial lesson today."

**What to Listen For:**
- **Life changes:** New job, moving abroad, relationship
- **Deadlines:** Upcoming trip, exam, presentation
- **Frustration:** Failed previous attempts, plateau
- **Opportunity:** Career advancement, new hobby

**Follow-Up:** "What happened that made this the right time?"

**How It Helps You:** Knowing their trigger lets you reference it throughout the trial. "Since you're moving to Berlin in 6 months, let's focus on practical daily conversations first."

---

#### 2. "What's the #1 thing you want to be able to do in [language]?"

**Why It Works:** Forces them to prioritize. Many students have vague goals like "become fluent." This question makes them specific.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Concrete goals:** "Order food in restaurants," "Give a presentation," "Understand movies"
- **Emotional goals:** "Feel confident speaking," "Connect with my partner's family"
- **Professional goals:** "Negotiate contracts," "Lead meetings"

**Follow-Up:** "If you could only achieve one thing in the next 3 months, what would it be?"

**How It Helps You:** Their #1 priority becomes your lesson focus. Reference it when proposing your teaching approach: "Since your main goal is feeling confident in conversations, I structure lessons to maximize speaking time."

---

#### 3. "Where do you see yourself using [language] in 6 months? A year?"

**Why It Works:** Reveals their vision of success and expected timeline. Some students want rapid progress; others prefer slow and steady.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Short-term vision:** Practical, urgent needs
- **Long-term vision:** Bigger dreams (living abroad, career change)
- **Unclear vision:** May need help defining goals (opportunity for you!)

**Follow-Up:** "What would change in your life if you reached that level?"

**How It Helps You:** Match your proposed lesson frequency and pace to their timeline. "To reach conversational confidence by your trip in April, I'd recommend twice-weekly lessons."

---

### Phase 2: Understanding Their History (5 minutes)

#### 4. "Have you tried learning [language] before? What worked and what didn't?"

**Why It Works:** Reveals past failures you can avoid and successes you can build on. Also uncovers their learning style preferences.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Apps (Duolingo, Babbel):** Good for basics, but no speaking practice
- **Group classes:** Not enough individual attention
- **Other tutors:** What was missing?
- **Self-study:** Motivation issues, no accountability

**Follow-Up:** "What specifically didn't work about [their previous method]?"

**How It Helps You:** Position yourself against what failed: "Unlike group classes where you spoke maybe 5 minutes per hour, my lessons are at least 70% you speaking."

---

#### 5. "What frustrates you most about learning [language]?"

**Why It Works:** Surfaces emotional pain points. Students pay to solve frustrations, not just learn grammar.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Grammar confusion:** "I never know which tense to use"
- **Speaking anxiety:** "I freeze when I try to speak"
- **Plateau feeling:** "I've been intermediate forever"
- **Retention issues:** "I forget everything by next week"

**Follow-Up:** "Can you give me an example of when you felt that frustration?"

**How It Helps You:** Address their frustration directly in your pitch: "That freezing feeling is so common—I use specific techniques to build speaking confidence gradually."

---

#### 6. "How do you prefer to learn—more speaking, more grammar, more reading?"

**Why It Works:** Shows you care about their preferences, not just imposing your teaching style.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Speaking-focused:** Conversation practice, role plays
- **Grammar-focused:** Rules, explanations, exercises
- **Balanced:** Mix of everything
- **Unsure:** They'll appreciate guidance

**Follow-Up:** "Are there any methods you know don't work for you?"

**How It Helps You:** Customize your approach description: "Based on what you've told me, I'd focus 60% on conversation with grammar explained naturally as it comes up."

---

### Phase 3: Understanding Logistics (5 minutes)

#### 7. "How much time can you realistically dedicate to learning each week?"

**Why It Works:** Sets realistic expectations. A student with 30 minutes weekly has different potential than one with 5 hours.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Total available time:** Lessons + homework + practice
- **Consistency:** Regular schedule or sporadic availability
- **Realism:** Do they overestimate their availability?

**Follow-Up:** "And of that time, how much is for lessons vs. self-study?"

**How It Helps You:** Recommend appropriate lesson frequency: "With 3 hours per week total, I'd suggest one 60-minute lesson with structured homework between."

---

#### 8. "What does your schedule look like? Any fixed commitments I should know about?"

**Why It Works:** Practical but also reveals work-life balance. Burned-out professionals need different energy than retirees.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Availability windows:** Morning, evening, weekends
- **Consistency potential:** Same time weekly or flexible
- **Stress indicators:** Very busy = keep lessons low-stakes and enjoyable

**Follow-Up:** "Is there a day/time that works best for consistent lessons?"

**How It Helps You:** Proactively suggest a schedule: "Based on your availability, how about Tuesdays at 7 PM? Consistency really helps retention."

---

#### 9. "Do you have any upcoming events that require [language]?"

**Why It Works:** Reveals hidden deadlines that create urgency and focus.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Trips:** Travel dates create natural milestones
- **Work events:** Presentations, meetings, conferences
- **Personal events:** Weddings, family visits, moves
- **Exams:** DELE, DELF, IELTS, etc.

**Follow-Up:** "What specifically will you need to do in [language] at that event?"

**How It Helps You:** Structure a plan around their deadline: "With your Paris trip in 8 weeks, let's focus on travel vocabulary and practical conversations first."

---

### Phase 4: Commitment & Objection Handling (5 minutes)

#### 10. "What's your biggest fear or concern about language learning?"

**Why It Works:** Surfaces objections before they become reasons not to book.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Fear of judgment:** "I'm worried about sounding stupid"
- **Fear of failure:** "I've failed before, what if I fail again?"
- **Time concerns:** "What if I'm too busy?"
- **Money concerns:** "Is it worth the investment?"

**Follow-Up:** "What would help you feel more confident about overcoming that?"

**How It Helps You:** Address fears directly with reassurance: "Making mistakes is actually how you learn fastest—I create a judgment-free zone where mistakes are celebrated."

---

#### 11. "How do you feel about homework between lessons?"

**Why It Works:** Gauges commitment level and sets expectations. Students who won't do homework need different lesson structures.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Eager:** "Yes, I love having things to practice!"
- **Hesitant:** "I'll try, but I'm busy"
- **Resistant:** "I was hoping to just do lessons"

**Follow-Up:** "What kind of homework would you actually enjoy and complete?"

**How It Helps You:** Customize homework expectations: "Since you're not a homework person, I'll assign just one 10-minute speaking practice you can do while commuting."

---

#### 12. "What questions do you have for me about how I teach?"

**Why It Works:** Gives them control, invites objections, and shows you're confident in your approach.

**What to Listen For:**
- **Method questions:** "How do you structure lessons?"
- **Progress questions:** "How fast can I improve?"
- **Logistics questions:** "What's your cancellation policy?"
- **Price questions:** "What are your rates?"

**Follow-Up:** Answer honestly and ask, "Does that address your concern?"

**How It Helps You:** Uncover hidden hesitations and address them before ending the trial.

## The Trial Lesson Structure

Here's how to fit these questions into a 30-60 minute trial:

### For a 30-Minute Trial:
- **0-15 minutes:** Discovery questions (choose 6-8 most important)
- **15-25 minutes:** Mini-lesson demonstrating your teaching style
- **25-30 minutes:** Recap, recommend next steps, handle objections

### For a 60-Minute Trial:
- **0-20 minutes:** Full discovery (all 12 questions)
- **20-45 minutes:** Teaching demonstration tailored to their goals
- **45-55 minutes:** Assessment and custom learning plan
- **55-60 minutes:** Discuss packages, booking, next steps

---

## How to Close the Trial

After your questions and mini-lesson, transition to the close:

**Summarize What You Learned:**
"Based on what you've shared—you want to feel confident speaking Spanish for your Mexico trip in 4 months, you've struggled with speaking anxiety in group classes, and you have about 3 hours per week to dedicate..."

**Present Your Recommendation:**
"I'd recommend we meet twice weekly for 45-minute conversation-focused lessons. I'll give you short, practical homework to practice between sessions. In 4 months, you'll be able to handle everyday situations confidently."

**Ask for the Commitment:**
"Does that plan sound like it would work for you? Should we book your first regular lesson?"

**Handle Hesitation:**
If they're unsure, ask: "What would help you feel confident about moving forward?"

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Won't asking so many questions feel like an interview?**
A: Frame it as personalized planning: "I want to make sure our lessons are exactly what you need, so I have a few questions to understand your goals better." Students appreciate that you care enough to ask.

**Q: What if the student has no clear goals?**
A: Help them define goals: "That's totally okay—let me suggest some options based on your situation..." Then offer 2-3 possible directions and let them choose.

**Q: Should I teach anything during the trial, or just ask questions?**
A: Both. Discovery takes 15-20 minutes; use remaining time to demonstrate your teaching style with a mini-lesson relevant to their stated goal.

**Q: How do I handle price objections?**
A: Tie value to their specific goals: "Based on what you've told me, reaching conversational confidence for your trip is worth more than the cost of lessons. And without structured practice, that goal stays out of reach."

**Q: What if they want to "think about it"?**
A: "Absolutely, take your time. What specifically would you like to think about?" This surfaces the real objection so you can address it.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake #1: Lecturing Instead of Listening**
The trial should be 70% them talking, 30% you. Your job is to understand, not impress.

**Mistake #2: Skipping to Teaching Too Fast**
Without understanding their goals, your teaching demo feels generic. The questions make your teaching feel personalized.

**Mistake #3: Not Asking for the Booking**
Many tutors end trials with "Let me know if you want to continue." Instead, recommend a specific next step and ask them to commit.

**Mistake #4: Treating All Trials the Same**
A retiree learning for fun needs a different approach than a professional with a deadline. Your questions reveal which approach to take.

---

## The Bottom Line

The best trial lessons aren't about proving you're a great teacher—they're about proving you understand the student better than anyone else.

When a student feels deeply understood, they don't want to start over with another tutor. They want to keep working with you.

**Your trial checklist:**
1. Ask questions that reveal their true motivation (Questions 1-3)
2. Understand their learning history and preferences (Questions 4-6)
3. Clarify logistics and expectations (Questions 7-9)
4. Surface and address concerns (Questions 10-12)
5. Recommend a specific plan tailored to their answers
6. Ask for the commitment

Master these 12 questions, and you'll convert more trials than you ever have before.
