### Thread 1: Commission Calculator Shock
```
🧵 I just calculated what 25 top language tutors on Preply lose to commission fees annually.

The numbers will shock you. 

Thread below 👇

1/8 Meet Sarah, English tutor from London:
• Monthly revenue: £3,200
• Preply commission: 25%
• Annual loss: £9,600

That's enough for a family holiday, car payment, or house deposit.

2/8 David, Spanish tutor from Barcelona:
• Monthly revenue: £1,800  
• Platform takes: £540/month
• Annual loss: £6,480

He's literally working 3 months per year for FREE.

3/8 The shocking truth:
- Average tutor loses £7,200/year to fees
- Top 10% lose £15,000+ annually
- Lifetime career loss: £144,000+

That's a house deposit. Gone.

4/8 Platform commission rates in 2024:
• Preply: 18-33% (brutal)
• iTalki: 15%
• Verbling: 15%
• TutorLingua: 0% ✨

The maths is simple. Zero commission = 100% of your money.

5/8 "But platforms bring me students!"

True. But here's the secret:

Use platforms for DISCOVERY.
Use direct booking for REPEAT BUSINESS.

Best of both worlds.

6/8 Real example:
Emma started with 5 Preply students.
Moved them to direct booking.
Now earns £400/month MORE with the same students.

That's £4,800 extra per year. From the same work.

### Thread 2: Platform Economics Exposé  
```
💰 THREAD: The brutal economics of language teaching platforms

I reverse-engineered exactly how much money tutors lose.

The numbers are absolutely criminal.

1/6 Platform business models in 2024:

Preply revenue: $100M+
Number of tutors: 32,000
Average commission per tutor: £3,125/year

They're literally millionaires... from YOUR work.

2/6 The commission trap:
• Year 1: "Just 18% isn't bad..."
• Year 2: "Wait, it's now 25%?"
• Year 5: "I've paid £35,000 in fees?!"

It adds up. It REALLY adds up.

3/6 Hidden costs you didn't know about:
- Payment processing: 2.9%
- Currency conversion: 3%
- "Service fees": Variable
- Actual total: Often 30%+

Your £20/hour lesson? You keep £14.

4/6 The repeat student scandal:

You find a student on Preply.
They love your teaching.
They book 50+ lessons with you.
Platform takes commission on EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.

That's not "finding students." That's rent-seeking.

5/6 What top earners do differently:

They use platforms for discovery only.
Move repeat students to direct booking.
Keep 100% of relationship value.

Smart tutors = zero commission tutors.

Stop funding other people's businesses with your teaching talent.

### Post 1: Professional Angle
```
🎯 Language tutors: You're being robbed in broad daylight.

Just spent 3 hours analysing commission structures across major platforms.

The data is staggering:

📊 Average tutor breakdown:
• Monthly revenue: £1,800
• Platform commission: £360 (20%)  
• Annual loss: £4,320
• 10-year career loss: £43,200

That's almost enough to buy a house. 

💡 The solution isn't leaving platforms entirely.
It's using them strategically:

✅ Platforms = student discovery
✅ Direct booking = repeat business  
✅ Zero commission = 100% revenue

I've been testing this approach with 50+ tutors.
Results: Average 30% income increase in 60 days.

### Post 2: Personal Story
```
💭 "Why did I build a zero-commission platform for language tutors?"

Because I was furious.

Last month, I met Elena - brilliant Spanish tutor, 4.9⭐ rating, 500+ students.

She showed me her earnings breakdown:
• Gross monthly: £2,400  
• Platform fees: £600
• Net income: £1,800

She was working an entire week every month... for FREE.

That's when I realised: 
Commission fees aren't a business model.
They're institutional theft.

🔥 6 months later:
- 50+ tutors using zero-commission platform
- Average 25% income increase
- Same students, same teaching, more money

The maths is simple:
£2,400 revenue × 0% commission = £2,400 take-home

No complex calculations. No hidden fees.
Just fair economics for education professionals.

Title: "Calculated how much I've lost to platform fees over 3 years - the number shocked me"

Body:
Hey fellow tutors 👋

Just did some painful maths on my teaching career.

Been on Preply for 3 years. Started tracking everything last month:

Year 1: £850/month revenue → £212.50 fees (25%)
Year 2: £1,400/month → £350 fees  
Year 3: £2,100/month → £525 fees

Total fees paid: £13,050

That's literally a family holiday every year. Gone.

Started researching alternatives and found platforms with zero commission. Tested moving my repeat students to direct booking.

Results after 2 months:
- Same students  
- Same lesson quality
- 25% more income
- Zero platform stress

Not saying abandon platforms entirely - they're great for finding new students. But maybe we don't need to pay commission on the same student for 2+ years?

Anyone else tracking their commission payments? What are your numbers?

Edit: Made a calculator to work out losses - happy to share if anyone wants it.

Title: "Platform economics are broken - here's the data"

Body:
Spent way too much time analysing tutor platform economics 🤓

Key findings:
• Average tutor pays £4,200/year in commission
• Platforms make £3,125/year per tutor (on average)  
• Top 1% of tutors subsidise platform growth
• Repeat student commission = pure profit for platforms

The business model is simple:
1. Attract tutors with low initial rates
2. Raise commission as they get established  
3. Profit from relationships tutors built

Alternative approach:
✅ Use platforms for discovery
✅ Direct booking for repeat business
✅ Keep relationships you've built

Has anyone successfully moved students to direct booking? What's worked?

```
Subject: Keep an extra £400/month? (2-min read)

Hi [Name],

Saw your excellent teaching profile on [Platform].

Quick question: would you be interested in keeping an extra £400-600/month from the same students you already teach?

I built a commission calculator that shows exactly how much tutors lose to platform fees. Most are shocked by the numbers.

[Your Platform] charges [%] commission.
If you're earning £[amount]/month, you're losing £[loss]/month to fees.

That's £[annual loss]/year that could stay in your pocket.

I've helped 50+ tutors transition to zero-commission direct booking while keeping their existing students.

Want to see your exact numbers?
→ Calculator: [link]

No catch. No strings. Just fair economics for language professionals.

Worth 2 minutes?

Best,
Malcolm

P.S. Most tutors had no idea how much they were actually losing until they calculated it. The numbers might surprise you.

### Follow-up Email
```
Subject: Re: Your commission calculation

Hi [Name],

Followed up because the commission calculator can be eye-opening.

Helped Emma (Spanish tutor) transition her 15 regular students to direct booking.

Before: £1,800/month → £1,350 after commission
After: £1,800/month → £1,800 take-home

Extra £450/month. Same students, same teaching.

The process:
1. Keep finding new students on platforms
2. Move repeat students to direct booking  
3. Keep 100% of relationship value

Zero risk. If it doesn't work, students stay on original platform.

Happy to show you exactly how if you're interested.

Best,
Malcolm
