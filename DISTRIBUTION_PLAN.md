# TutorLingua "Magic Recap" Distribution & Marketing Plan

**Target:** Independent language tutors on Preply, iTalki, Verbling, Cambly who want to own their student relationships

**Product:** Free lesson recap tool → 30-sec summary → interactive study page with AI vocab cards, exercises, shareable link

**Built-in virality:** "⚡ Generated by TutorLingua" watermark on every recap link

**Hook:** After 3 recaps, soft-lock to account creation (email capture)

---

## Executive Summary

**Core Strategy:** Product-led growth through value-first, zero-friction tool that tutors will use *during* their existing workflow, with students spreading awareness organically.

**Key Insight:** Tutors on platforms like Preply/iTalki are already creating recaps manually (Word docs, WhatsApp messages, emails). Magic Recap makes this 10x easier and 100x more professional — while building your brand alongside theirs.

**Three-Phase Approach:**
1. **Seed (Weeks 1-2):** Manual outreach → first 50 tutors → validate product-market fit
2. **Community (Weeks 3-6):** Strategic community engagement → word-of-mouth → content marketing
3. **Scale (Months 2-3):** Paid acquisition → partnerships → SEO dominance

---

## Phase 1: SEED (Weeks 1-2) — First 50 Tutors

**Goal:** Get 50 active tutors using Magic Recap, generating feedback and early viral loops

   - r/italki (tutors sharing tips)
   - r/languagelearning (crossover with tutors)
   - r/EnglishLearning (tutors answer questions here)

2. **Facebook Groups** (search for these specific groups)

   - "iTalki Teachers Support Group" (private, ~5K members)
   - "Preply Tutors Lounge" (private, ~8K members)
   - "TEFL Teachers Worldwide"
   - "Language Tutors Connect"

**Reddit Post Example (r/OnlineESLTeaching):**

```
Title: Built a free tool to generate lesson recaps in 30 seconds (with AI vocab cards)

Hey everyone! 👋

I noticed a lot of tutors (myself included) spend 10-15 minutes after each lesson typing up recaps for students — grammar points, new vocab, practice exercises, etc.

I built a free tool that does this in 30 seconds. You just speak or type a quick summary → it generates a shareable link with:
- Interactive vocabulary cards (with audio)
- Custom practice exercises
- Clean, professional study page for your student

No signup needed for the first 3 recaps. Just wanted to share in case it saves anyone time!

[Link]

Would love feedback from this community. What features would make this more useful for you?
```

**Why this works:**
- Leads with the pain (wasting time on recaps)
- Shows you're "one of them" (tutor)
- Value-first (free, no signup)
- Asks for feedback (community contribution, not promotion)

**Facebook Group Approach:**
- Join groups first, engage authentically for 2-3 days
- Then post similar message adjusted to group tone
- Respond to *every* comment asking about workflow/tools with Magic Recap as a solution

**LinkedIn DM Template (to tutors actively posting):**

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your post about [specific thing they mentioned]. I'm building a tool for independent tutors that auto-generates lesson recaps with AI vocab cards.

Would you be open to trying it (free, no signup) and sharing feedback? I'm looking for input from experienced tutors like yourself.

[Link to demo video or landing page]
```

#### **Week 2: Refine + Double Down (Target: 25 more tutors)**

- Analyze which channels converted best in Week 1
- A/B test messaging
- Start collecting testimonials from first 25 users
- Use testimonials in outreach

**KPIs for Week 1-2:**
- 50 active tutors using Magic Recap
- 150+ recaps generated
- At least 10 tutors who've created 3+ recaps (hit the soft-lock → email captured)
- 5-10 pieces of qualitative feedback on features/UX
- 3-5 testimonials or screenshots for social proof

   - Share screenshots of students using the recap links
   - Post in r/languagelearning: "My tutor sends me these awesome study links after every lesson"

## Viral Mechanics Built Into Product

### 1. The Recap Link Watermark

**Current:**
"⚡ Generated by TutorLingua" on every study page

**Optimization:**
- Make watermark clickable → drives direct traffic
- A/B test variations:
  - "⚡ Get this for your lessons — free at TutorLingua.com"
  - "Made with TutorLingua ✨ — Try it free"
  - "Your tutor uses TutorLingua 💡"

**Virality Math:**
- Average tutor: 10 students
- Each student sees ~4 recaps per month
- 100 tutors = 1,000 students × 4 = 4,000 watermark impressions/month
- At 2% click-through = 80 new tutor signups (organic)

### 2. Student → Tutor Referral Loop

**Trigger:** When students love the recap

**Mechanism:**
- Add subtle CTA on student-facing page: "Ask your tutor about TutorLingua recaps"
- When student asks, tutor discovers tool (if not already using)
- Student becomes advocate: "My tutor sends these amazing study links"

**Implementation:**
- Footer on recap page: "Learning a language? Find a tutor who uses TutorLingua"
- Links to directory of tutors (builds marketplace later)

### 3. Tutor → Tutor Referral Incentives

**Referral Program:**
- Tutor shares referral link with other tutors
- When friend signs up and creates 3 recaps, both get:
  - Unlock of premium feature (custom branding, advanced analytics)
  - Or credit toward future paid plan

**Incentive Structure:**
- 1 referral = 1 month premium free
- 5 referrals = 6 months premium free
- 10+ referrals = Lifetime premium + TutorLingua swag

**Promotion:**
- Email to existing users: "Share with a fellow tutor"
- In-app prompt after 5th recap: "Loving Magic Recap? Share with a colleague"

### 4. Built-in Network Effects

**The Magic:**
- More tutors using = more students exposed
- More students asking "where'd you get this?" = more tutors discovering
- More recaps in the wild = more brand visibility

**Amplification:**
- Encourage tutors to post screenshot of recap on Instagram/TikTok
- Create "Tutor Spotlight" series featuring power users
- Run monthly contest: "Best recap of the month" (voted by students)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Conversion from Free to Paid
**Mitigation:**
- Focus on value delivery in free tier (make it genuinely useful)
- Gradual upsell (after 10+ recaps, offer premium features)
- Clear differentiation between free and paid (custom branding, analytics, integrations)

### Risk 2: Tutors Don't See Value (Product-Market Fit Issue)
**Mitigation:**
- Intensive feedback loop in Phase 1 (talk to every early user)
- Rapid iteration on features based on tutor needs
- Build for specific use case (lesson recaps) before expanding

### Risk 3: Competition from Established Players
**Mitigation:**
- Focus on niche (independent tutors, not schools)
- Speed to market (launch fast, iterate faster)
- Community-first approach (build loyal user base early)

### Risk 4: Platform Dependence (Reddit algorithm changes, etc.)
**Mitigation:**
- Diversify channels (YouTube, TikTok, email, SEO)
- Owned media (email list, blog)
- Direct relationships with power users

### Risk 5: Watermark Virality Doesn't Work
**Mitigation:**
- A/B test watermark placement and messaging
- Add referral incentives to amplify
- Supplement with active marketing (not relying solely on organic)

## How Similar Tools Grew (Lessons to Steal)

### Case Study: Calendly

**What they did:**
- Free tier with genuine value (no credit card)
- Built for individual users first, not enterprises
- Viral loop: Every meeting link = free advertising
- Focused on one use case (scheduling) and did it perfectly

**What we can steal:**
- Start free, add value, monetize later
- Every recap link = free ad for TutorLingua
- Perfect one workflow (lesson recaps) before expanding

### Case Study: Loom

**What they did:**
- Solved specific pain (async video communication)
- Product-led growth: video itself was the marketing
- Strong community presence (educators loved it)
- Chrome extension = zero friction

**What we can steal:**
- Recap link is the marketing (students share it)
- Target educators specifically (they're vocal, share tools)
- Make it ridiculously easy to use (30 seconds, no signup)

### Case Study: Notion

**What they did:**
- Free for individuals, paid for teams
- Template community (users creating for users)
- Notion ambassadors program

- SEO-driven blog strategy

## FAQ & Objections

### "Won't tutors just use ChatGPT for free?"

**Answer:**
ChatGPT gives raw text. Magic Recap gives:
- Formatted, shareable study page
- Interactive vocab cards with audio
- Built-in exercises
- Professional presentation
- Saved links tutors can reuse/edit

We're not competing with ChatGPT — we're making it useful for tutors' specific workflow.

### "Why would tutors pay for this?"

**Answer:**
They won't — not at first. Free tier is genuinely useful forever (after soft-lock).

Premium tier ($15/month) offers:
- Custom branding (remove TutorLingua watermark, add their logo)
- Advanced analytics (student engagement tracking)
- Integration with scheduling tools
- Unlimited recaps (vs. soft-lock at 3)
- Priority support

Target: 5-10% conversion rate from free to paid.

### "What if platforms like iTalki build this feature?"

**Answer:**
By the time they do, we have:
- 2,000+ loyal tutor users
- Strong brand ("the recap tool")
- Integrations across platforms (not locked to one)
- Feature depth (we're focused, they're generalists)
- Community (tutors recommend us to each other)

Speed is our advantage — launch fast, iterate faster, own the category.

### "How do you make money if it's free?"

**Answer:**
**Phase 1-2:** Build user base, don't monetize heavily
**Phase 3:** Launch premium tier ($15/month) with valuable features
**Future:** Platform fees (charge $0.50 per recap for ultra-high-volume users), enterprise plans (language schools), marketplace (directory of tutors using TutorLingua)

Freemium model with slow monetization = sustainable growth.

## Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months)

### Month 6:
- **5,000+ active tutors**
- **50,000+ recaps generated**
- **500+ paying accounts** ($7,500 MRR)
- Platform integrations (iTalki, Preply partnerships)
- Launch "TutorLingua Academy" (free courses for tutors)

### Month 12:
- **20,000+ active tutors**
- **250,000+ recaps generated**
- **2,000+ paying accounts** ($30,000 MRR)
- Launch marketplace (students find tutors via TutorLingua)
- Expand to adjacent tools (scheduling, student management)
- Raise seed round to scale faster

**The Goal:**
Become the operating system for independent language tutors. Magic Recap is the trojan horse — the free tool that gets us in the door. From there, we own the workflow.

---

## Final Thoughts

**This isn't just a distribution plan — it's a movement.**

Independent tutors are tired of platforms taking 20-30% commission. They want to own their student relationships, build their brand, and get paid fairly for their work.

Magic Recap helps them do that. It's not just a tool — it's a statement: "I'm a professional tutor. I deliver value. And I don't need a platform to do it."

**The virality is built in:**
- Every recap link is an ad
- Every student who loves it tells their friends
- Every tutor who saves time refers another

**The community is hungry:**
- Reddit: thousands of tutors asking "what tools should I use?"
- Facebook: private groups where tutors share everything
- YouTube: tutor channels teaching other tutors
- TikTok: #tutortok is exploding

**The timing is perfect:**
- Independent tutoring is booming (post-pandemic shift)
- AI tools are mainstream (tutors are ready to adopt)
- Platforms are raising fees (tutors want independence)

**Launch fast. Listen hard. Iterate faster.**

This plan gets you to 2,000 tutors in 3 months. But the real goal is building a brand tutors love and trust. A tool they can't live without. A community they want to be part of.

Make it happen. 🚀
