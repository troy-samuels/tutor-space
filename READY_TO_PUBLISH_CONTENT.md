🧵 I just calculated what 25 top language tutors lose to platform fees annually.

The numbers are absolutely criminal.

Thread below 👇

1/9 Meet Sarah, English tutor from London:
• Monthly revenue: £3,200
• Preply commission: 25%  
• Annual loss: £9,600

That's literally a family holiday every year. Gone.

2/9 David, Spanish tutor from Barcelona:
• Monthly revenue: £1,800
• Platform takes: £540/month
• Annual loss: £6,480

He's working 3.6 months per year for FREE.

3/9 Emma, IELTS specialist from Manchester:
• Monthly revenue: £2,400
• Commission: 28%
• Annual loss: £8,064

That's a house deposit. Vanished.

4/9 The brutal reality:
- Average tutor loses £7,200/year to fees
- Top 10% lose £15,000+ annually  
- 10-year career loss: £144,000

That's enough to buy a house. Gone forever.

5/9 Platform commission rates in 2024:
• Preply: 18-33% (absolutely brutal)
• iTalki: 15%
• Verbling: 15%
• Cambly: Variable but high

The house always wins. Until now.

6/9 "But platforms bring me students!"

True. Here's the secret successful tutors use:

✅ Platforms = student DISCOVERY
✅ Direct booking = REPEAT business

Best of both worlds. Zero commission on relationships YOU built.

7/9 Real case study:
Emma moved 12 repeat students to direct booking.
Same students. Same teaching quality.
Extra £672/month in her pocket.

That's £8,064 extra per year. From work she was already doing.

Most tutors had no idea until they saw the numbers.

**Topic:** Professional angle on platform economics

🎯 Language tutors: You're being robbed in broad daylight.

Just spent 6 hours analysing commission structures across major platforms.

The data is absolutely staggering:

📊 Average professional tutor breakdown:
• Monthly revenue: £2,100
• Platform commission: £420 (20%)
• Annual loss: £5,040
• 10-year career loss: £50,400

That's literally enough for a house deposit.

💡 The solution isn't abandoning platforms entirely.
It's using them strategically:

✅ Platforms = student discovery
✅ Direct booking = repeat business
✅ Zero commission = 100% revenue

I've been testing this approach with 30+ tutors over 3 months.
Results: Average 28% income increase with same teaching load.

**Title:** "Calculated my 3-year platform commission costs - the number made me physically sick"

```
Hey fellow tutors 👋

Just did some really painful maths on my teaching career.

Been primarily on Preply for 3 years. Finally tracked everything properly:

**Year 1:** £950/month revenue → £238/month fees (25%)
**Year 2:** £1,600/month revenue → £400/month fees  
**Year 3:** £2,300/month revenue → £575/month fees

**Total commission paid over 3 years: £14,556**

That's literally enough for:
- Brand new car
- Family holiday every year
- House deposit contribution
- Emergency fund

All gone. To a platform. For bookings I could have handled myself.

The wake-up call came when I realised most of my students have been with me for 8+ months. I'm not paying commission for "discovery" anymore - I'm paying rent on relationships I built.

Started researching zero-commission alternatives. Found some interesting options.

Question for the community: Has anyone successfully moved repeat students to direct booking? What worked? What didn't?

Not trying to abandon platforms entirely - they're great for finding new students. But maybe we don't need to pay 25% commission on the same student for 2+ years?

**Edit:** Made a calculator to work out exact losses for anyone curious: [will share in comments if there's interest]

**Update:** Holy crap, the response to this is insane. Sharing the calculator since so many asked: tutorlingua.com/calculator

Apparently this is a bigger issue than I thought. We should probably talk about this more as a community.

Hi [Name],

Saw your excellent [subject] teaching on [platform].

Quick question: have you calculated how much you pay annually in platform commission?

Built a tool that shows exact numbers. Most tutors are genuinely shocked.

At [estimated rate]/hour on [platform], you're likely paying £[estimated annual loss]/year in fees.

That's real money that could stay in your pocket.

Calculate your exact losses: tutorlingua.com/calculator

Takes 30 seconds. No email required. Just brutal honesty about platform economics.

Worth a look?

Best,
Malcolm

P.S. Most tutors had no idea how much they were actually paying until they saw it calculated out. The numbers can be eye-opening.
