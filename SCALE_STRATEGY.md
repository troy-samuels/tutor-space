# TutorLingua — Scalable Tutor Acquisition Strategy

*Malcolm — 14 Feb 2026*

---

## The Problem

We have 79,406 Preply tutor IDs but 97% are "Natalia S." — unsearchable, uncontactable outside the platform. Traditional outbound (email, LinkedIn, social) is a dead end for all but ~3% of the market.

**We need to make them come to us.**

---

## The 7 Channels (ordered by scale × speed)

### 1. 🔌 CHROME EXTENSION — "Honey for Tutor Profiles"
**Reach: Every tutor who installs × every profile they visit, forever**
**Status: Built ✅**

The extension injects a score badge on every Preply/iTalki tutor profile page. Scores run client-side (zero server cost). Click to expand for full breakdown + recommendations + TutorLingua CTA.

**Why it's the #1 play:**
- Intercepts tutors WHERE THEY ALREADY ARE
- No contact info needed — reads the page directly
- Passive: install once, works on every single profile visit
- Works for tutors (checking their own + competitors) AND students (browsing)
- Competitive research hook: tutors obsessively browse competitor profiles
- Shareable: "I got 43/100 — what did you get?"

**Distribution for the extension itself:**
- Every other channel below drives installs
- Chrome Web Store listing optimised for "Preply profile", "tutor profile score"
- Extension page on tutorlingua.com with install CTA

**Next steps:** Test on live Preply page → Chrome Web Store upload ($5 dev fee)

---

### 2. 📘 FACEBOOK GROUPS — Direct Access to 10K+ Tutors
**Reach: 10,000-50,000 tutors across key groups**
**Effort: Low (1-2 posts per group)**

**Confirmed group:** "PREPLY for tutors" — active, posts about getting more students dated Jan 2026.

**Other target groups (to find/join):**
- "Independent Online ESL Teachers" (confirmed from earlier research)
- "Online English Teachers"
- "ESL Teachers Worldwide"
- "Cambly Teachers"
- "iTalki Teachers"

**The post that works:**
> "I built a free tool that scores your tutor profile and tells you exactly what to fix. No signup, no catch — just paste your Preply/iTalki URL and get a breakdown in 10 seconds.
>
> It checks your headline, bio, differentiation, pricing strategy, keywords, and review sentiment. Most profiles I've tested score between 40-55 out of 100 — the top earners score 75+.
>
> Link: [profile analyser URL]
>
> There's also a Chrome extension that shows the score directly on any Preply profile page while you browse.
>
> Happy to take feedback — I built this specifically for tutors on commission-based platforms."

**Why it works:** These groups are FULL of "how do I get more students?" posts. A free tool that answers that question will spread organically within the group.

**Timing:** Post when engagement is highest (weekday mornings, when tutors check between lessons)

---

### 3. 💼 LINKEDIN — The Bypass Channel (Full Names!)
**Reach: 58,800+ followers on "Tutor with Preply" company page, thousands of individual profiles**
**Effort: Medium**

**Critical finding:** LinkedIn is where Preply tutors USE THEIR FULL NAMES. The "Natalia S." problem doesn't exist on LinkedIn.

**"Tutor with Preply" company page:** 58.8K followers. This means at least 58K tutors follow this page and self-identify as Preply tutors.

**Three LinkedIn angles:**

**A) Scrape tutor LinkedIn profiles via Google dorks**
- `"tutor at preply" site:linkedin.com` → pages of results with FULL NAMES
- Cross-reference with Preply data to identify high-value targets
- Send connection requests + personalised messages at scale
- "I noticed you teach [subject] on Preply — I built a free profile analyser that might help..."

**B) Content on LinkedIn that tutors see**
- Post research findings: "We analysed 10,000 Preply tutor profiles. Here's what the top 1% do differently."
- Tag "Tutor with Preply" page to appear in their follower feeds
- LinkedIn articles rank well in Google → SEO benefit

**C) LinkedIn Ads targeting Preply tutors**
- Target: followers of "Tutor with Preply" company page
- Target: job title "Tutor" + interests "Preply" / "online teaching"
- Ad: "How strong is your Preply profile? Free AI analysis →"
- LinkedIn ads are expensive but EXTREMELY targeted for this use case

---

### 4. 🔍 SEO CONTENT — Capture High-Intent Searches
**Reach: Thousands of tutors/month searching for help**
**Effort: Medium (one-time content creation, long-term payoff)**

**Confirmed high-volume searches (from Google results):**
- "how to get more students on preply" — multiple Reddit threads, YouTube videos, Preply help articles
- "preply profile tips" / "preply profile score"
- "how to become a super tutor preply"
- "preply tutor ranking algorithm"
- "preply alternative for tutors"
- "how to advertise yourself as a tutor"

**Content to create (on tutorlingua.com/blog):**

| Article | Target Keyword | Intent |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| "We Scored 10,000 Preply Profiles — Here's What Top Earners Do Differently" | preply profile tips | Research/tool |
| "How to Get More Students on Preply in 2026: The Data-Backed Guide" | how to get more students preply | How-to |
| "Preply vs Teaching Independently: The Real Maths" | preply alternative for tutors | Comparison |
| "The Preply Algorithm Decoded: What Actually Affects Your Ranking" | preply tutor ranking | Technical |
| "How to Become a Super Tutor on Preply (Based on 500 Profiles)" | how to become super tutor preply | Goal-oriented |
| "What Students Actually Look For When Browsing Tutor Profiles" | how to stand out on preply | Psychology |

Each article ends with: "Check your own profile score → [analyser link]" + "Get the Chrome extension → [link]"

**Key insight from Google results:** Preply's own help articles rank for these terms, but they're generic. YouTube videos by individual tutors rank well. Reddit threads rank. There's a clear gap for data-backed, specific content.

---

### 5. 📹 YOUTUBE — The Trust Engine
**Reach: Thousands of views per video in a niche with clear demand**
**Effort: Medium-High**

**Confirmed demand:**
- "How to Get More Students on Preply" by Mark Hemming (Jul 2024) — ranks #1
- "Preply Help - How to get more students!" by Teacher Cook-E (Jun 2021) — ranks high
- "How to get more students on Preply" by Yurishka Venter (Jun 2022) — ranks high
- "Preply Advice - How to Get Students During the Summer" by Teacher Cook-E (Jun 2025)

**These are individual tutors making advice videos — NOT companies.** This is a wide-open content gap for a tool/brand.

**Video ideas:**
1. "I Scored 1,000 Preply Tutor Profiles — Here's What I Found" (screencast of tool + data)
2. "Your Preply Profile Score: LIVE Analysis" (score viewer profiles on stream)
3. "5 Profile Mistakes Costing Preply Tutors 60% of Bookings" (data from our analysis)
4. YouTube Shorts: quick before/after profile scores

**Collab opportunities:**
- Teacher Cook-E, Mark Hemming, Yurishka Venter — all make Preply advice content
- Offer them the extension + analyser to feature
- "I tried TutorLingua's free profile scorer — here's what it said about my profile"

---

### 6. 🗣️ REDDIT — Community Seeding
**Reach: 16K+ weekly visitors on r/Preply alone**
**Effort: Low**

**Target subreddits (confirmed active):**
- r/Preply — "How do I get more students?" posts regularly
- r/OnlineESLTeaching
- r/TutorsHelpingTutors
- r/ESL_Teachers
- r/iTalki
- r/languagelearning (student side)

**Two types of posts:**

**A) Tool announcement (one-time per subreddit):**
> "Built a free profile analyser for Preply/iTalki tutors — scores your profile out of 100"

**B) Value-first comments on existing threads:**
Every time someone asks "how do I improve my Preply profile?", comment with genuine advice + "there's a free tool that does this automatically: [link]"

**Reddit advantage:** Posts rank in Google. A well-upvoted Reddit post about the tool will appear in Google for "preply profile tips" etc. — feeding back into the SEO channel.

---

### 7. 🤝 TUTOR TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS — Capture at Entry
**Reach: Every new tutor entering the market**
**Effort: High (outreach required), but compounds**

**TEFL/CELTA/TESOL providers** train thousands of new tutors every year. When graduates complete their certification, they immediately go to Preply/iTalki to start teaching.

**The pitch:**
- "Offer our free profile analyser to your graduates as a career resource"
- "Include our Chrome extension recommendation in your 'getting started as an online tutor' guide"
- Co-branded: "TutorLingua × [TEFL Provider] Profile Optimiser"

**Target providers:**
- TEFL.org, i-to-i TEFL, International TEFL Academy
- The TEFL Org UK, TEFL Institute
- Cambridge English (CELTA programs)
- British Council (Teaching English resources)

**Why they'd do it:** It's free, it's genuinely useful for their graduates, and it makes their program look more comprehensive.

**Every channel feeds the analyser. The analyser feeds the extension. Both feed signups. Signups feed word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth feeds all channels.**

## Viral Mechanics (Built Into the Tool)

### Shareable Score Cards
- Generate an OG image for every analysis: "Natalia S. — Profile Score: 43/100"
- When shared on social, it auto-previews with the score
- "Check your score →" CTA in the card
- Even "Natalia S." names work here — sharing is peer-to-peer, not search-based

### Leaderboard by Niche
- "Top IELTS tutors by profile quality" / "Top Business English tutors"
- Anonymised: "Tutor #47 — Score: 89/100 — £45/hr — 4.97 rating"
- Competitive tutors want to be #1 → check and improve their own

### Referral System
- "Invite 3 tutors → unlock premium AI analysis (full profile rewrite suggestions)"
- Free analysis = 6 dimensions. Referred analysis = AI-powered specific rewrite suggestions
- This turns every user into a distribution channel

### "What Did You Score?" Social Pressure
- After showing the score, prompt: "Share your score with fellow tutors"
- Pre-written tweet/LinkedIn post: "My tutor profile scored [X]/100 on TutorLingua. How does yours compare?"
- This is the Wordle mechanic — people share results because it's fun and competitive
