## Outreach Message Templates

### LinkedIn Cold Message (Professional)
```
Hi [Name],

Noticed your excellent work teaching [subject] on [platform]. 

Quick question for someone clearly successful in online teaching: have you calculated your annual platform commission costs?

Built a tool that shows exact numbers - most tutors at your level are shocked by what they're paying annually.

Worth 2 minutes if you're curious: [calculator link]

No sales pitch - just thought you'd find the data interesting.

Best,
Malcolm
```

### Instagram DM (Casual)
```
Love your teaching content! 

Quick question - as someone obviously doing well with tutoring, have you ever calculated how much you pay in platform fees annually?

Made a calculator that shows the exact numbers. Most tutors had no idea how much they were actually giving away.

Might be worth a look: [link]

Keep up the great content! 🎓
```

### Email Follow-up
```
Subject: Your platform commission calculation

Hi [Name],

Following up on the commission calculator I mentioned.

Quick backstory: helped Emma (another [subject] tutor) calculate she was losing £5,400/year to platform fees.

Same students. Same teaching quality. Different booking system.

Now she keeps that £450/month instead of giving it away.

Calculator shows your exact numbers: [link]

Worth 2 minutes to see what you're actually paying.

Best,
Malcolm

P.S. Zero pressure - just thought you'd find the data eye-opening like most tutors do.
