## User Journey Map: Features by Stage

Understanding where features fit in the tutor's lifecycle helps prioritize development and improve user experience at each stage.

### 🎯 Stage 1: Discovery & Acquisition
**Goal**: Attract tutors and reduce friction to sign up

| Feature | Priority | Why It Matters | Timeline |
|---------|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Free Tier or Extended Trial** | 🔥 P0 | Lowers barrier to entry; competes with Beacons' free plan | Q1 2025 |
| **Referral & Affiliate System** | 🔶 P1 | Viral growth through tutor communities | Q2 2025 |
| **Marketplace/Discovery** | ⚪ P2 | Helps new tutors find first students | Q4 2025 |

**Current State**: No free tier creates acquisition friction. Tutors must commit $59/mo before testing platform.

**Recommendation**: Start with **60-day extended trial** (Option B) to reduce risk while maintaining quality bar. Keep the username field in signup so tutors immediately reserve their public handle (critical for trust and SEO), but reinforce its value with inline helper text (“This will be your public URL: tutorlingua.com/@username”). Pair the trial with a **Free Onboarding Sprint** that tutors complete in the first 14 days:

### Free Onboarding Sprint (14-day, fully featured)
1. **Launch Kit Selection** – Tutor picks a preferred topic (Exam Prep, Kids Immersion, Business Fluency, Heritage Learners, Seasonal Promo). We instantly scaffold the landing structure, proof widgets, and CTA layout tailored to that niche.
2. **Brand & Copy Pass** – Guided checklist walks them through uploading brand assets and answering 3 AI prompts (language, audience, differentiator). The site sections update automatically, and the sprint tracker marks Task 1 complete.
3. **Service Package Setup** – Checklist step ensures at least one 1:1 package (price, duration, buffer) plus an optional bundle is published. Provide ready-made templates per topic so tutors simply tweak pricing.
4. **Payment Link + Calendar Sync** – Final step connects Stripe and availability. Once payments + calendar are live, the sprint publishes the public booking page and fires a “Launch Complete” email.

If the tutor completes all steps within 14 days, Professional stays free until they log the first paid booking—an “activation guarantee” that Beacons can’t match.

- **Outcome-focused selection flow**: During signup, tutors choose a preferred topic (e.g., Exam Prep, Kids Immersion, Business Fluency, Heritage Learners, Seasonal Promo). Each choice loads a curated landing structure—hero copy, proof blocks, CTA layout, and recommended pricing tiers—so they start with messaging tailored to their niche.
- **Lesson Funnel blueprints**: Every topic includes matching lead magnets, onboarding emails, and booking CTA microcopy to move visitors from landing page → lead capture → paid lesson.
- **AI-powered customization**: After choosing a topic, tutors answer 3–4 prompts (language taught, target student age, differentiator). The system rewrites the sections automatically, keeping the build “plug and play” while still feeling bespoke.
- **Activation guarantee**: “Launch your Tutor Launch Kit + win your first paying student in 60 days or we extend Professional for free.” This underscores TutorLingua’s outcome focus and differentiates from Beacons’ generic link pages.

Track activation metrics closely as the launch kit rolls out.

### 🚀 Stage 2: Onboarding & Activation
**Goal**: Get tutors to launch their site and book their first student quickly

| Current Features (Strong) | Gap Features (To Add) | Priority |
|---------------------------|----------------------|----------|
| ✅ Website builder | Onboarding checklist | Future |
| ✅ Booking system setup | Video tutorials | Future |
| ✅ Payment integration | Template library | Future |
| ✅ Availability calendar | Quick-start guide | Future |

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- Time to first booking (target: <7 days)
- % of users who complete profile setup
- % of users who set up payment processing

**Current State**: Core onboarding features are strong. No immediate gaps.

---

### 💼 Stage 3: Active Usage (Early Students)
**Goal**: Support tutors as they start teaching their first 1-5 students

| Current Features (Strong) | Gap Features (To Add) | Priority | Timeline |
|---------------------------|----------------------|----------|----------|
| ✅ Student CRM | **Email Marketing** | 🔥 P0 | Q1 2025 |
| ✅ Session scheduling | **Digital Products** | 🔥 P0 | Q1 2025 |
| ✅ Progress tracking | Mobile app (session notes) | ⚪ P2 | Q3 2025 |
| ✅ Parent portal | - | - | - |
| ✅ Payment processing | - | - | - |

**Why Email Marketing is Critical Here**:
- Tutors with 3-5 students need simple tools to stay in touch
- Welcome emails, session reminders, and progress updates improve retention
- Prevents students from going inactive

**Implementation (Current Iteration)**:
- Growth plan now includes a **campaign composer** with AI templates tied to launch-kit topics, richer audience filters (inactive 30+ days, never booked, status groups), and personalization tokens.
- Campaigns support **scheduling + batching** (queue processed via cron, 50 emails/run) so tutors can plan launches without hitting SMTP limits.
- **Automations**: Toggle auto-welcome for new students and auto re-engagement after X days of inactivity; both route through the same queue for deliverability.
- **Deliverability & compliance**: Students have opt-out tokens, emails include an unsubscribe link, and an `/email-unsubscribe` page updates preferences instantly.
- **Future**: add drip sequences + deep analytics once tutors request more automation depth.

**Why Digital Products Fit Here**:
- After teaching 10-20 sessions, tutors have materials to sell
- Low-effort revenue stream ($29-99 study guides)
- Complements 1-on-1 teaching without adding complexity

**Implementation (Current Iteration)**:
- Tutors can create digital products (upload file or external link), price them, and publish shareable storefronts at `/products/{username}`.
- Stripe checkout flow captures payment; once webhooks confirm, buyers get a branded email containing an expiring download link (`/api/digital-products/download/{token}`) with download limits enforced.
- Dashboard includes a Digital Products manager (create, publish/hide, delete) under Run the Business navigation.
- Data model covers products + purchases with Stripe product/price IDs, preparing the ground for future bundles and analytics.

### 📈 Stage 4: Growth & Scaling (6-20 Students)
**Goal**: Help tutors grow revenue, manage more students, and scale beyond 1-on-1

| Feature | Priority | Why It Matters | Timeline |
|---------|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Group Classes & Workshops** | 🔶 P1 | Scale revenue per hour (1 tutor → 5-8 students) | Q2 2025 |
| **Mini-Courses (Self-Paced)** | 🔶 P1 | Passive income; serve students who can't afford 1-on-1 | Q2 2025 |
| **Advanced Email Automations** | 🔶 P1 | Re-engage inactive students; upsell packages | Q2 2025 |
| **Mobile App** | ⚪ P2 | Convenience for busy tutors managing 15+ students | Q3 2025 |

**Tutor Pain Points at This Stage**:
- Time management: Too many 1-on-1 sessions → burnout
- Revenue ceiling: Can only teach 20-25 hours/week
- Student churn: No system to re-engage inactive students

**How Features Address Pain Points**:
- **Group classes**: 5x revenue per hour vs. 1-on-1
- **Self-paced courses**: Passive income while sleeping
- **Email automations**: Prevent churn, fill empty time slots

---

### 🏆 Stage 5: Maturity & Retention (20+ Students)
**Goal**: Retain successful tutors; support advanced workflows; prevent churn to competitors

| Feature | Priority | Why It Matters | Timeline |
|---------|----------|----------------|----------|
| **White-Label (Agencies)** | ⚪ P3 | Serve tutoring agencies with multiple tutors | 2026 |
| **Advanced Analytics** | Current | Already exists; continue improving | Ongoing |
| **API/Integrations** | Future | Connect to Zoom, Google Calendar, accounting software | TBD |
| **Team/Assistant Accounts** | Future | Delegate admin work to VAs | TBD |

**Current State**: Strong retention features already exist (CRM, AI tools, analytics). Focus on acquisition and growth stages first.

## Strategic Recommendations by User Journey Stage

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Q1 2025) - Focus on Stage 3 & 4

#### 1. **Email Marketing Integration** 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
**User Journey Stage**: Stage 3 (Active Usage) → Stage 4 (Growth)

**Why**: Tutors with 3-20 students need simple communication tools to:
- Welcome new students (Stage 3)
- Send session reminders to reduce no-shows (Stage 3)
- Re-engage inactive students (Stage 4)
- Announce new services or availability (Stage 4)

**Implementation**:
- Simple email composer within TutorLingua dashboard
- Pre-built templates for common tutor needs:
  - Welcome email for new students
  - Session reminder (24hr before)
  - Package expiration reminder
  - Monthly progress updates
  - Re-engagement campaigns for inactive students
- Audience segmentation (active students, inactive, parents, by language/level)
- Basic automation (welcome series, session reminders)

**Competitive Advantage**: Unlike Beacons' generic email tool, TutorLingua templates are tutor-specific

**Estimated Development**: 3-4 weeks

---

#### 2. **Digital Products Marketplace** 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
**User Journey Stage**: Stage 3 (Active Usage) → Stage 4 (Growth)

**Why**: After teaching 20-50 sessions, tutors naturally create:
- Lesson plans and worksheets
- Practice exercises
- Study guides

This feature monetizes existing materials without extra teaching time.

**Implementation**:
- Sell downloadable resources:
  - Lesson plans and worksheets
  - Practice exercises and answer keys
  - Study guides and cheat sheets
  - Recorded mini-lessons or explanations
- Simple upload → price → publish workflow
- Integrated with existing payment processing
- Option to bundle products with session packages

**Use Cases**:
- Stage 3 tutor: "Buy my Spanish verb conjugation cheat sheet for $9"
- Stage 4 tutor: "Get 10 sessions + my DELE exam prep guide ($199 value) for $399"
- Passive income between teaching sessions

**Competitive Advantage**: Integrated with student relationship (can recommend products to specific students based on their progress)

**Estimated Development**: 3-4 weeks

---

#### 3. **Free Tier or Extended Trial** 🔶 STRATEGIC DECISION
**User Journey Stage**: Stage 1 (Discovery & Acquisition)

**Why**: Lower barrier to entry; compete with Beacons' free plan

**Option A: Limited Free Tier**
- Free forever with limitations:
  - Basic profile page (bio, photo, contact info)
  - Max 3 students
  - Max 5 bookings/month
  - TutorLingua branding
  - No custom domain
- Upgrade required for: CRM, parent portal, AI tools, unlimited students

**Option B: Extended Free Trial** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- 60-day full-feature trial (vs. standard 14-day)
- Credit card required (reduces abuse)
- Onboarding checklist to drive activation
- Email sequence with tips and case studies

**Option C: Freemium Hybrid**
- Free: Profile page only (replacement for link-in-bio)
- Paid: Everything else (booking, payments, CRM, AI)

**Recommendation**: Start with **Option B (60-day extended trial)** to validate demand, then consider Option A if conversion rates are too low

**Why 60 days?**: Tutors need time to:
- Set up their site (Week 1)
- Find first students via existing channels (Weeks 2-4)
- Teach several sessions and see value (Weeks 5-8)
- Decide if they want to commit long-term

**Estimated Development**: 1-2 weeks

---

### Phase 2: Value Additions (Q2 2025) - Focus on Stage 4 & 5

#### 4. **Group Classes & Workshops**
**User Journey Stage**: Stage 4 (Growth & Scaling)

**Why**: Tutors with 10-15 students hit a time ceiling. Group classes solve this by:
- 5x revenue per hour (5 students × $20/each vs. 1 student × $50)
- Building community among students
- Allowing tutors to "scale" without burning out

**Implementation**:
- Create group class offerings (max participants, recurring schedule)
- Group booking system with waitlist
- Differentiated pricing (group rate vs. private)
- Group chat or discussion board for students
- Shared progress tracking

**Use Cases**:
- "Conversational Spanish for Beginners" (weekly group class, 5 students max, $20/person)
- "IELTS Prep Workshop" (4-week intensive, 8 students, $299/person)

**Competitive Advantage**: Most link-in-bio tools don't handle group bookings well

**Estimated Development**: 4-6 weeks

---

#### 5. **Mini-Courses & Self-Paced Content**
**User Journey Stage**: Stage 4 (Growth & Scaling)

**Why**: Tutors want passive income to serve students who:
- Can't afford 1-on-1 tutoring ($40-80/hour)
- Want self-paced learning
- Need prep before booking live sessions

**Implementation**:
- Course builder with lessons, videos, quizzes, assignments
- Drip content (unlock lessons over time or after completion)
- Student progress tracking
- Certificates of completion
- Pricing: one-time payment or subscription

**Use Cases**:
- "30-Day French Pronunciation Course" ($79 one-time)
- "Business English Email Writing" (5 modules, self-paced, $149)

**Funnel**: Free mini-course → upsell to 1-on-1 tutoring

**Differentiation from Beacons**: Integrated with tutoring services (can offer course + 3 live Q&A sessions bundle)

**Estimated Development**: 6-8 weeks

---

#### 6. **Referral & Affiliate System**
**User Journey Stage**: Stage 1 (Acquisition) + Stage 3-5 (Active tutors refer peers)

**Why**: Best acquisition channel is word-of-mouth from happy tutors

**Implementation**:
- Give each tutor a unique referral link
- Reward structure:
  - Referrer: 1 month free or $20 credit per paid signup
  - Referee: 20% off first 3 months
- Affiliate dashboard (track clicks, signups, earnings)
- Payout via Stripe or platform credit

**Use Cases**:
- Tutor communities share referral links
- Language teaching Facebook groups
- Reddit threads about becoming a tutor

**Estimated Development**: 2-3 weeks

---

### Phase 3: Long-Term Enhancements (Q3-Q4 2025) - Focus on Stage 4 & 5

#### 7. **Mobile App**
**User Journey Stage**: Stage 4 (Growth) → Stage 5 (Maturity)

**Why**: Tutors with 15+ students need convenience for:
- Adding session notes immediately after lesson (on phone)
- Checking upcoming sessions between lessons
- Quick messaging with parents
- Managing availability on-the-go

**Priority Features**:
- View upcoming sessions and student details
- Add session notes immediately after lesson
- Quick messaging with students/parents
- Notifications for new bookings
- Availability management

**Not Needed in v1**: Full website editing, complex scheduling

**User Journey Fit**: Only matters once tutors are managing many students (Stage 4+). Not a priority for new tutors.

**Estimated Development**: 12-16 weeks (iOS + Android)

---

#### 8. **Marketplace/Discovery**
**User Journey Stage**: Stage 1 (Acquisition) + Stage 2 (Onboarding)

**Why**: Help brand-new tutors find their first 3-5 students

**Implementation**:
- Opt-in tutor directory (searchable by language, level, price, location)
- Profile preview → book directly on tutor's TutorLingua site
- No commission on bookings (unlike Preply/iTalki)
- Paid placement/promotion for premium visibility

**Business Model Options**:
- Free listing for all Professional+ subscribers
- Pay for featured placement ($29/mo for top of search)
- Or keep it free to drive platform value

**Important**: Positioning is critical—this is a discovery tool to complement tutors' existing marketing, not a replacement for Preply

**Estimated Development**: 8-12 weeks

---

#### 9. **White-Label Option for Tutoring Agencies**
**User Journey Stage**: Stage 5 (Maturity) - Different buyer persona

**Why**: Higher ACV; serve tutoring companies with multiple tutors

**Implementation**:
- Agency dashboard (manage multiple tutor accounts)
- Custom branding (agency logo, colors, domain)
- Centralized billing and reporting
- Student assignment to tutors
- Agency-level analytics

**Pricing**: $299-499/mo (10-25 tutors) or custom enterprise pricing

**User Journey Fit**: This is an **enterprise play**, not part of the indie tutor journey. Different buyer, different sales motion.

**Estimated Development**: 12+ weeks

---

## What NOT to Build

### ❌ Social Media Features
- **Why**: Tutors don't need a "link-in-bio" with 50+ links
- **TutorLingua's focus**: Professional website, not social media hub
- **Skip**: Instagram feed embeds, TikTok videos, social media icons everywhere

### ❌ Generic Creator Tools
- **Why**: TutorLingua is not for YouTubers, influencers, or content creators
- **Skip**: Media kits, sponsorship management, merch stores, NFT drops

### ❌ Tips/Donations
- **Why**: Tutors charge for services, not donations
- **Skip**: "Buy me a coffee" style tipping (not aligned with professional positioning)

---

---

## Conclusion

TutorLingua's strength is **vertical specialization**—it's not trying to be everything to everyone. The goal is not to compete feature-for-feature with Beacons.ai, but to be **the obvious choice for serious language tutors**.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. ✅ Keep doubling down on tutoring-specific features
2. ✅ Add strategic features where they align with tutors' business needs (email, digital products)
3. ✅ Consider free tier to lower acquisition friction
4. ❌ Don't chase generic creator features
5. ✅ Position as "professional tutoring platform" not "link-in-bio for tutors"
