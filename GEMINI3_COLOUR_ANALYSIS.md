# TutorLingua Colour Analysis — Gemini 3 Pro Preview
*Generated: Feb 14, 2026*

## Verdict: Strong foundation, but too "vintage" — needs more energy for the student/game side

### Key Insights

1. **Burnt orange + forest green** — Evokes "grounded growth." Feels organic and human, avoids corporate blue. BUT it lacks "electric" energy. Burnt orange is a "slow" colour — says "study" not "play." Currently feels like a boutique coffee shop, not a language learning powerhouse.

2. **Competitor differentiation** — High. Successfully avoiding Duolingo green, Preply blue, Cambly yellow. Forest green as secondary anchor is the unique "Academy" signature.

3. **WCAG AA** — White text on `#D36135` fails AA for normal text (~3.0-4.0:1). Critical fix needed.

4. **Cream background `#FDF8F5`** — Premium, IF executed with high whitespace. Reduces eye strain for long study sessions. But paired with too much brown/rust → becomes "sepia-toned" and dated. Needs something cooler/sharper to cut the warmth.

5. **Dark mode** — Concept is sound, but current accents too desaturated. Games need luminous accents against dark backgrounds for excitement.

## Three Strategic Shifts

1. **"Electric Mandarin"** — Shift primary to vibrant mandarin for high-value actions (Start Lesson, Subscribe). Keep burnt orange for branding/illustration only.

2. **Split "Brand Green" vs "Success Green"** — Forest green for logo/borders. New mint/jade for "Correct Answer" feedback (forest green recedes too much for positive reinforcement).

3. **"Focus Indigo"** — Deep warm indigo as tertiary support. Balances overwhelming warmth. Adds intellectual depth. Prevents "1970s interior" look.

### Pro Tip
Use `#FFFFFF` surface liberally in light mode. Cream-on-cream = unstructured. White cards on cream = "Premium Stationery" aesthetic.
