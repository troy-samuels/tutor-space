Hi [Name],

Saw your excellent language teaching on [Platform]. Quick question - 
would you be interested in keeping 100% of your student revenue instead of losing [%] to platform fees?

I've built a commission-free booking platform for independent tutors. 
Would you be curious to see how much you could save?

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges:
1. **Platform ToS violations** → Use public information only, avoid scraping
2. **Spam complaints** → Personalised messages, value-first approach  
3. **Low conversion rates** → A/B test all messaging, optimise based on data
4. **Influencer rejections** → Have backup list, improve value proposition

### Backup Strategies:
- **Paid advertising** if organic reach insufficient
- **Partnership with existing communities** if direct outreach limited
- **Content collaboration** with current users for social proof
