I've been teaching English for over 20 years. I create my own materials and teach my students how to take control of their English learning. My approach is unconventional, but it gets results. It's built on neuroscience and decades of practical experience. This is a proven system for mastering real-world English, no matter your level or background. I spent years refining this method. Now it's your turn to use it. I live on Sixth Street in Austin, Texas. I hold a Master's degree in Teaching English from Drahomanov National Pedagogical University and a verified Preply Language Teaching Certificate. I've taught over 20,000 one-on-one English lessons on Preply, and just as many off the platform, helping adults master English for work and life.","specialties":["Conversational English","Business English","English for beginners","American English","Intensive English","For everyday use","English for traveling","English job interview prep","English for Software Engineers","English for CEO"],"headline":"NeuroMethod Expert | 20+ Years Helping Adults Master English","youtube_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjSpsmcke9A","website_url":null,"scraped_at":"2025-07-17T14:02:00Z"}
