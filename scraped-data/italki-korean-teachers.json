I specialize in Levantine Arabic (the dialect you’ll hear in shows, songs, and streets) and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) for formal needs. Whether you want to chat naturally, understand slang, or ace work-related Arabic, I’ll tailor lessons to your pace—with patience and real-life practice. Let’s turn textbook words into confident conversations!",

The goal is to help you speak more naturally and confidently. I'm very patient and will always speak slowly and clearly to help you understand.",
