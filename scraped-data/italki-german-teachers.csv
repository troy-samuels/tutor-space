I specialize in Levantine Arabic (the dialect you’ll hear in shows, songs, and streets) and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) for formal needs.

The goal is to help you speak more naturally and confidently. I'm very patient and will always speak slowly and clearly to help you understand.","5.0","1221","13124","https://www.youtube.com/embed/BV6_jSh0amo","https://www.youtube.com/embed/BV6_jSh0amo","13119","1","1",,,"https://www.italki.com/en/teacher/6382719"
