# TutorLingua — YouTube Creator Outreach Emails

## Strategy
- Lead with THEIR content (show we've watched/read their stuff)
- Reference specific pain points they've raised
- Position TutorLingua as the answer to problems they already talk about
- Keep it short — these people get pitched constantly
- No attachments, no long decks — just a link and a hook
- Ask for their opinion, not their endorsement (lower barrier)

## EMAIL 1: Bonisile Xaba (@liferesetwithboni) — 109K subs
**To:** Boni@liferesetwithboni.com
**Subject:** Your Preply earnings video — what if the commission was 0%?

Hi Boni,

I watched your recent video breaking down Preply tutor earnings and it really resonated. You laid out the numbers honestly — something most platforms would rather tutors didn't think too hard about.

I'm building TutorLingua (tutorlingua.co), a tutoring platform that charges tutors 0% commission. No cut from trial lessons, no sliding scale, no hidden fees. Tutors keep everything they earn.

We're early stage and looking for experienced voices in this space. I'd genuinely love your take on whether this model could work for the tutors in your audience. No pressure to promote anything — I just think your perspective would be incredibly valuable.

Would you be open to a quick chat or even just checking out the calculator we built? (calculator.tutorlingua.co — it shows tutors exactly how much they'd save vs Preply/iTalki.)

Cheers,
Troy

**To:** seansmthembu@gmail.com
**Subject:** Your Preply review — thought you'd want to see this

Hi Sean,

Came across your Preply review for South African tutors and really appreciated the honest breakdown. The fact you've since built your own online school tells me you already get what most tutors take years to figure out — platforms take too much and give back too little.

I'm working on TutorLingua (tutorlingua.co), a 0% commission tutoring platform. No cut whatsoever. We handle the marketplace, scheduling, and payments — tutors keep 100%.

Given you've been on both sides (platform tutor and running your own school), I'd love to get your take on whether this is something your audience would find useful. We built an earnings calculator that shows tutors exactly what they'd save: calculator.tutorlingua.co

Happy to chat anytime if you're interested.

**To:** dlindiwe759@gmail.com
**Subject:** Quick question about your online teaching content

Hi Carol,

I saw your video about making R10,000/month teaching online with no qualifications — the engagement in the comments tells me you've got an audience that really wants to make this work.

I'm building TutorLingua (tutorlingua.co), a platform where tutors pay 0% commission. Everything they earn, they keep. No sliding scale, no trial lesson cuts, nothing.

I think your audience — especially people trying to build income from South Africa — would find this really interesting. Would you be open to taking a look and sharing your honest thoughts?

No strings attached. If it's not for your audience, no worries at all.

## YOUTUBE DM / CONTACT FORM 4: Rachael Roberts (@earnlearnthrive) — 3.61K subs, 107K viral video
**Channel:** Via YouTube DM or earnlearnthriveinelt.com contact
**Subject:** Re: your "Why Preply is NOT worth it" video

Hi Rachael,

Your video on why Preply isn't worth it has clearly struck a nerve — 107K views says it all. And your broader message about helping teachers earn more while working less is exactly the problem I'm trying to solve from the platform side.

I'm Troy, building TutorLingua — a 0% commission tutoring marketplace. No cut from lessons, no trial lesson fees, nothing. The tutor keeps everything.

I know you coach teachers to go independent, and I think there's an interesting overlap here. TutorLingua gives tutors the marketplace exposure (which is the hard part of going solo) without the commission penalty.

I'd love to get 15 minutes of your time — genuinely interested in your perspective as someone who's been in ELT for 30 years. Even if it's just "here's why this won't work" — I want to hear it.

## YOUTUBE DM / BLOG COMMENT 5: Martin Sketchley (@ELTExperiences) — 24.6K subs
**Channel:** Via YouTube DM, Twitter @eltexperiences, or blog comment on eltexperiences.com
**Subject:** Your Preply honest review — built something you might want to see

Hi Martin,

Just read your full honest review of Preply on ELT Experiences — probably the most thorough breakdown I've seen anywhere. The part about commission starting at 33% and the declining student numbers is exactly the problem I've been trying to solve.

I'm building TutorLingua (tutorlingua.co) — a tutoring platform with 0% commission. After 5+ years on Preply and 19 years teaching, you know better than most how much those fees eat into what tutors actually take home.

We're early stage and I'd genuinely value your perspective. You've seen the platform model from every angle. Would you be open to checking it out and sharing your honest take? Even a brutal "this won't work because X" would be useful.

Also built an earnings calculator (calculator.tutorlingua.co) that shows tutors exactly what they'd save — might be interesting for your blog/channel content.
